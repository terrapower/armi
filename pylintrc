[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# ** Reasons disabled **
# bad-whitespace: Not well justified. Need autoformatter.
# trailing-whitespace: Not well justified.
# missing-param-doc: Not well justified
# missing-type-doc: Not well justified
# missing-return-type-doc: Not well justified
# docstring-first-line-empty: Triggers on multi-line docstrings
# locally-disabled: It's appropriate to decide to violate pylint sometimes
# superfluous-parens: Python 2 and 3 compatibility
# too-many-locals: annoying
# bad-continuation: https://github.com/ambv/black/issues/48
# too-many-instance-attributes: Some of our classes are big and could use refactoring, but this can
#     be a bit overzealous
# too-many-*: ditto above
# missing-return-doc: Pylint doesnt appear to support numpydoc return specs
# too-few-public-methods: Strage issue for a language that seems to promote type-as-data as a
#     popular idiom
# useless-object-inheritance: New-style classes in python 2
# no-else-return: multiple return statements are not considered bad practice
# duplicate-code: The duplicate code pylint founds is just not interesting.
