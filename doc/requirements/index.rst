Requirements

.. note:: Work In Progress: The ARMI Requirements are thus-far incomplete.

This section gives a general overview of the requirements of ARMI. These requirements
are meant to satisfy NRC regulations and also give a firm basis for the high-level
goals of ARMI.

ARMI's requirements are tracked in this documentation and linked to specific
implementations in the source code or configuration. Ideally, each requirement will
be linked to both unit tests and source code within the ARMI repository.
