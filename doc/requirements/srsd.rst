Business Impact
---------------

#. The ``database`` package is used to restart runs, analyze results, and determine when changes are introduced to otherwise identical cases in ARMI. The ``database`` package is considered high risk.
#. The ``report`` package is one of many tools available for viewing case details and is intended purely for developer or analyst feedback on run specifications and results, not as a means of altering the run. Thus the ``report`` package is low risk.
#. The ``blueprints`` package interprets user input into an ARMI reactor model. If done incorrectly, ARMI simulations would be unreliable and inaccurate. ARMI is used for informing core designs, engineering calculations, and safety bases; therefore, the ``bluperints`` package is considered high risk.
#. The ``settings`` package contains a substantive amount of the run's definition. Problems in the settings system can invalidate runs. Fortunately, the errors are easily traced and replicated as the system itself is not complicated. Therefore, the ``settings`` package is considered high risk.
#. The ``operator`` package is paramount to every facility the code offers, affecting every aspect of design. Thus, the ``operator`` packages is high risk.
#. The ``fissionProductModel`` package has substantial impact on the results of the neutronic calculations that affect the plant design. Thus, it falls under the **high risk** impact level.
#. The ``reactor`` package contains the majority of state information throughout a case. Issues in it
could propagate and invalidate results derived from ARMI to perform design and analysis. Therefore, the ``reactor`` package is considered high risk.
#. The ``nucDirectory`` package contains nuclide-level information including names, weights, symbols, decay-chain, and transmutation information. This information is used for converting mass fractions to number densities, and identifying specific nuclides to be used in used in performing flux and burn-up calculations. Therefore, the ``nucDirectory`` package is considered high risk.
#. The ``nuclearDataIO`` package is used to read and write nuclear data files which are used as input to global flux solvers, and eventually input into safety calculations via reactivity coefficients. Therefore, the ``nuclearDataIO`` package is considered high risk.

Many analysis tasks require high performance computing (HPC), and the operator package shall contain utilities and routines to communicate with an HPC and to facilitate execution of simulations in parallel.

.. req:: The operator package shall allow physics coupling between analysis plugins.
   :id: REQ_OPERATOR_COUPLING
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

For coupled physics (e.g. neutronics depends on thermal hydraulics depends on neutronics), the operator package shall allow loose and/or tight coupling. Loose coupling is using the values from the previous timestep to update the next timestep. Tight is an operator-splitting iteration until convergence between one or more plugins.

.. req:: The operator package shall allow analysis plugins to be replaced without affecting interfaces in other plugins.
   :id: REQ_OPERATOR_ANALYSIS
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

Often, a plugin is replaced with a new plugin fulfilling some new requirement. When this happens, the operator package shall isolate required changes to the new plugin. For example, if a fuel performance plugin needs temperatures but the temperature-computing plugin is replaced, the fuel performance plugin should require no changes to work with the drop-in replacement. This requires modular design and standardization in state names.

.. req:: The nucDirectory package shall contain basic nuclide information for a wide range of nuclides.
   :id: REQ_NUCDIR_DATA
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

- natural isotopic abundance of elements
- atomic number (Z)
- mass number (A)
- atomic weight
- meta stable state

   :id: REQ_NUCDIR_FILES
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

The software shall be made flexible such that the definition of specific nuclides available (i.e. those used in a version of MCC), can be updated without modifying the code.

TODO: This can be tested by inspecting the logic of the code to retrieve data from a resource file, or by modifying the resource file to create an expected outcome.

.. req:: The nucDirectory package shall enforce unique nuclide names.
   :id: REQ_NUCDIR_UNIQUE
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

The nuclides names shall be unique, and consist of the nuclide's symbol, mass number, and an indication if it is in a meta-stable state. Elemental nuclides shall omit the mass number, since they represent more than a single mass number. Lumped nuclides shall also have unqiue, user-data identified names.

TODO: A unit test can be used to demonstrate that all nuclide names are unique.

.. req:: The nucDirectory package shall be capable of generating unique 4-character labels.
   :id: REQ_NUCDIR_LABELS
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

Versions 2 and 3 of MCC allow for unique 6 character labels to be used to reference nuclides. Two characters need to be used to describe the different cross section sets used by the problem. Therefore, every nuclide in ARMI needs to have a unique 4 character representation to use in MCC and the downstream global flux solver.

TODO: A unit test can be used to demonstrate that all nuclides have unique 4-character labels.

.. req:: The nucDirectory package shall allow for use of lumped nuclides.
   :id: REQ_NUCDIR_LUMPED
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

Lumped nuclides are bulk defined nuclides that are typically used when modeling fission products. Lumping the nuclides during burnup calculations lowers the problem size without having a significant impact on the results. Consequently, they do not always need to be modeled individually, but can be grouped.

TODO: A unit test can be used to demonstrate that lumped nuclides can be used and created.

.. req:: The nucDirectory package shall allow for elemental nuclides.
   :id: REQ_NUCDIR_ELEMENTALS
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

The nuclear data libraries available in versions 2 and 3 of MCC do not always allow for nuclide input, and some materials are grouped into elemental nuclides. Iron is an example of this in MCC version 2. Consequently, ARMI needs to be able to model elemental nuclides which represent the entire element, as well as the individual nuclides.

.. req:: The nucDirectory package shall allow for dummy nuclides.
   :id: REQ_NUCDIR_DUMMY
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

Dummy nuclides, typically written in all capitals as "DUMMY", are used to truncate the burn chain in order to reduce the problem size without compromising the results.

.. req:: The nucDirectory package shall allow for indexing of nuclide information.
   :id: REQ_NUCDIR_INDEX
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

The nuclear data files created by physics codes such as MCC and DIF3D may not necessary correspond to the name used within ARMI, it will be necessary to load nuclide information based on a non-ARMI name. The software shall provide lookup mechanisms for nuclide objects based on:

- Name
- 4-character label
- MCC versions 2 and 3 IDs

.. req:: The nucDirectory package shall contain decay chain data.
   :id: REQ_NUCDIR_DECAY_CHAIN
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

The decay chain is an important step in performing burn-up calculations. The nucDirectory shall contain necessary decay mechanisms:

- `\beta^-`
- `\beta^+`
- `\alpha`
- Electron capture
- Spontaneous fission

The nucDirectory shall contain the half-life, decay mode(s) with corresponding branch ratio(s) and daughter nuclide(s) of each decay mode being modeled. Since it is possible for the user to define specific nuclides to be modeled, the nucDirectory shall allow for use of different daughter nuclides.

TODO: A unit test can be generated to test that the correct decay chain is present, and that the data matches other resources.

.. req:: The nucDirectory package shall contain transmutation data.
   :id: REQ_NUCDIR_TRANSMUTE
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

In addition to the decay chain, nuclides may transmute through interactions into other nuclides. The nucDirectory shall contain transmutations including:

- `n,2n`
- `n,p`
- `n,t`
- `n,\fission`
- `n,\gamma`
- `n,\alpha`

The nucDirectory shall contain the transmutation mechanism, branch ratio, and product nuclides of each transmutation being modeled. The nucDirectory shall not contain the cross sections, as these are calculated using lattice physics codes, such as MCC. Since it is possible for the user to define specific nuclides to be modeled, the nucDirectory shall allow optional daughter nuclides.

TODO: A unit test can be generated to test that the correct transmutations are present, and corresponding data matches other resources.

.. req:: The nucDirectory package shall warn the user if there are potential burn-chain faults.
   :id: REQ_NUCDIR_BURN_CHAIN
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

The user supplies the nuclides to be modeled in the simulation; therefore, it is possible that the user may inadvertently describe a burn-chain that is not complete. The software shall be capable of detecting erroneous user input and terminate the program.

TODO: A unit test can be generated with faulty decay chains to determine that they do not work.

.. req:: The nuclearDataIO package shall read and write ISOTXS files.
   :id: REQ_NUCDATA_ISOTXS

The software shall be capable of reading an ISOTXS file into memory, and writing it out to a file that is exactly the same as the original.

TODO: A unit test can be created with reads an ISOTXS file generated by MCC, and then writes out the file to another name. The two files can then be compared using a binary file comparison to demonstrate that the contents of the files are identical.

.. req:: The nuclearDataIO package shall read and write GAMISO files.
   :id: REQ_NUCDATA_GAMISO
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

GAMISO files are generated by MCC-v3, and are the same format as an ISOTXS file. The file contains photon interaction cross sections instead of neutron cross sections.

The software shall be capable of reading a GAMISO file into memory, and writing it out into a file that is exactly the same as the original.

TODO: This can be covered in a unit test; the unit test can be the same as described for ISOTXS files.

.. req:: The nuclearDataIO package shall read and write PMATRX files.
   :id: REQ_NUCDATA_PMATRX
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

PMATRX files contain the gamma production matrix resulting from fission or capture events. Given a neutron flux distribution, and a PMATRX file, the gamma source can be computed and then used to determine gamma transport and heating.

.. req:: The nuclearDataIO package shall be capable of reading a PMATRX file into memory, and writing it out into a file that is exactly the same as the original.

TODO: This can be covered in a unit test; the unit test can be the same as described for ISOTXS files.

.. req:: The nuclearDataIO package shall read and write DLAYXS files
DLAYXS files contain delayed neutron data, such as precursor decay constants and number of neutrons emitted, :math:`\nu_{\mathrm{delay}}`. The DLAYXS data is used to calculate :math:`\beta_{\rm{eff}}`, which is used to calculate reactivity coefficients, and consequently in AOO and accident simulations.

The software shall be capable of reading a DLAYXS file into memory, and writing it out into a file that is exactly the same as the original.

TODO: This can be covered in a unit test; the unit test can be the same as described for ISOTXS files.

   :id: REQ_NUCDATA_MERGE
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

The software shall be capable merging multiple files of the same type (ISOTXS, PMATRX, etc.) into a single file meeting the specifications. The software shall fail with a descriptive error message if any two nuclides have the same name.

This can be covered in a unit test which runs 3 MCC-v3 cases.

1. Generate cross sections for a set of nuclides with the xsID=AA 1. Generate cross sections for a set of nuclides with the xsID=AB 1. Generate cross sections with two regions using an input file containing the nuclides of the above two cases.

The third MCC-v3 case will produce a merged ISOTXS file which can be compared to an ISOTXS file generated by merging the output ISOTXS from cases 1 and 2.

.. req:: The nuclearDataIO package shall make the data programmatically available.
   :id: REQ_NUCDATA_AVAIL
   :status: needs implementation, needs test

The software shall make the nuclear data provided in ISOTXS, GAMISO, PMATRX and DLAYXS available in the form of Python objects, such that it can be used elsewhere in the code, such as in the depletion, nuclear uncertainty quantification, and `\beta` calculations.

   .. req:: The nuclearDataIO package shall key nuclear data based on nuclide label and xsID.
      :id: REQ_NUCDATA_AVAIL_LABEL
      :status: needs implementation, needs test

When nuclear data files are read, they should be made available in a container object, such as a dictionary, and keyed on the nuclide label (a unique four character nuclide identifier) and the cross section ID, a two character identifier for block type and burnup group.

TODO: This can be covered by a unit test which reads an ISOTXS into a container object, and then obtaining cross sections by using the nuclide label and xsID.

   .. req:: The nuclearDataIO package shall be able to remove nuclides from specifc nuclear data files.
      :id: REQ_NUCDATA_AVAIL_FILES
      :status: needs implementation, needs test

ARMI has a concept of "lumped fission products" that result in more nuclides being in ISOTXS, GAMISO, and PMATRX files than are needed for subsequent calculations. The software shall be capable of removing the unused nuclides from ISOTXS, GAMISO, and PMATRX files. This generally does not apply to DLAYXS files, because they typically only contain nuclides that fission.

TODO: This can be covered by a unit test where a file is read in, a nuclide removed, and then rewritten and reread. The reread file should not contain the removed nuclides.

   .. req:: The nuclearDataIO package shall be able to modify the nuclear data.
      :id: REQ_NUCDATA_AVAIL_MODIFY
      :status: needs implementation, needs test

In order to calculate the uncertainties of our methodology introduced by nuclear data uncertainty, it is necessary to be able to perturb (i.e. modify) specific values within the nuclear data files.

    :id: REQ_REPORT_TECH
    :status: needs implementation, needs test

Given the functional requirements of the report package, new developers should be able to understand how to contribute to a report nigh instantly. No new technologies should be introduced to the system as HTML and ASCII are both purely text-based.

    :id: REQ_NUCDIR_DATA
    :status: needs implementation, needs test
