Utilities Package
-----------------

This section provides requirements for the :py:mod:`armi.utils` package within the framework, which is one of the smaller high-level packages in ARMI. This package contains a small set of basic utilities which are meant to be generally useful in ARMI and in the wider ARMI ecosystem. While most of the code in this section does not rise to the level of a "requirement", some does.
