Settings Package
----------------

This section provides requirements for the :py:mod:`armi.settings` package, which is responsible for providing a centralized means for users to configure an application. This package can serialize and deserialize user settings from a human-readable text file. When a simulation is being initialized, settings validation is performed to enforce things like type consistency, and to find incompatible settings. To make settings easier to understand and use, once a simulation has been initialized, settings become immutable.
