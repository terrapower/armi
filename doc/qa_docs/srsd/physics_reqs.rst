Physics Package
---------------

This section provides requirements for the :py:mod:`armi.physics` package within the framework, which contains interfaces for important physics modeling and analysis in nuclear reactors. It is important to note that ARMI is a framework, and as such does not generally include the actual science or engineering calculations for these topics. For instance, ARMI has an interface for "safety analysis", but this interface is just a *place* for developers to implement their own safety analysis code. It would be inappropriate to include the actual science or engineering calculations for a detailed safety analysis of a particular reactor in ARMI because ARMI is meant only to house the code to let nuclear modeling and analysis work, not the analysis itself.
