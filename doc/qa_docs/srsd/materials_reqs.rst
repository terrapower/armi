Materials Package
-----------------

This section provides requirements for the :py:mod:`armi.materials` package within the framework, which contains ARMI's system for defining materials. The materials system in ARMI allows for an extreme amount of flexibility in defining materials with temperature-dependent properties like density, linear expansion factor, and the like.

ARMI also comes packaged with a small set of basic materials, though these are meant only as example materials and (because ARMI is open source) these materials can not include proprietary or classified information. As such, we explicitly forbid the use of the example ARMI materials in safety-related modeling and will not be writing requirements on those materials.
