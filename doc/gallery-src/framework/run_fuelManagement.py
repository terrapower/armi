Fuel management in a LWR
========================

Demo of locating and swapping assemblies in a core with Cartesian geometry. Given a burnup
distribution, this swaps high burnup assemblies with low ones.

Assembly selection for moving and swapping is very flexible using the ARMI API and the
high-level language features of Python. This allows highly complex fuel management
algorithms to be expressed and parameterized.

Because the ARMI framework does not come with a LWR global flux/depletion solver, actual
flux/depletion results would need to be provided by a physics plugin before actually using
ARMI to do fuel management. Thus, this example applies a dummy burnup distribution for
demonstration purposes.
