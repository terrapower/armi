Plotting a multi-group scatter matrix.
======================================

Here we plot scatter matrices from an ISOTXS microscopic cross section library.
We plot the inelastic scatter cross section of U235 as well as the (n,2n) source
matrix.

See Also: :py:mod:`ISOTXS <armi.nuclearDataIO.isotxs>` format.
