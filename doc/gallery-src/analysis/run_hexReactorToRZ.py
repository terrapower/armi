Hex reactor to RZ geometry conversion
=====================================
This shows how an entire reactor specified in full hex detail can be
automatically converted to a 2-D or 3-D RZ case with conserved mass.

.. warning::
    This uses :py:mod:`armi.reactor.converters.geometryConverters`, which
    will only work on a constrained set of hex-based geometries. For your systems,
    consider these an example and starting point and build your own converters as
    appropriate.
