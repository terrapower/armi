Write MCNP Material Cards
=========================

Here we load a test reactor and write each component of one fuel block out as
MCNP material cards.

Normally, code-specific utility code would belong in a code-specific ARMI
plugin. But in this case, the need for MCNP materials cards is so pervasive
that it made it into the framework
