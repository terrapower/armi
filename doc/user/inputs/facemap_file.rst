**********************
The Facemap Input File
**********************

Given a set of defined assemblies in the :doc:`/user/inputs/blueprints`, their arrangement in a
reactor is defined by the Facemap input file (sometimes called the geometry file). This is a very simple
XML format file that is almost always created using the GUI described in :doc:`/user/inputs/settings`, though
it can be edited manually as well.

Find an example format of the Facemap file in the :doc:`/tutorials/walkthrough_inputs`.

.. note:: You can point many ARMI runs to the same Facemap input file using full paths.
