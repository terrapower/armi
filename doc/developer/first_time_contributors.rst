*****************************
First Time Contributors Guide
*****************************

The ARMI team strongly encourages developers to contribute to the codebase.

The ARMI framework code is open source, and your contributions will become open source.
Although fewer laws apply to open source materials because they are publicly-available, you still
must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

Help Wanted
===========

There are a lot of places you can get started to help the ARMI project and team:

* Better :doc:`documentation </developer/documenting>`
* Better test coverage
* Many more type annotations are desired. Type issues cause lots of bugs.
* Targeted speedups (e.g. informed by a profiler)
* Additional relevance to thermal reactors

Naturally, you can also look at the open `ARMI issues <https://github.com/terrapower/armi/issues>`_ to see what work needs to be done. In particular, check out the `help wanted tickets <https://github.com/terrapower/armi/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22>`_ and `good first issue tickets <https://github.com/terrapower/armi/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`_.

Testing
=======

Any contribution must pass all included unit tests. You will frequently have to fix
tests your code changes break. And you should definitely add tests to cover anything
new your code does.

The standard way to run the tests is to install and use `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_::

    $ pip install tox
    $ tox -- -n 6

This runs the unit tests in parallel on 6 processes. Omit the ``-n 6`` argument
to run on a single process.

Or the tests can also be run using ``pytest`` directly::

    $ pip intall -e .[test]
    $ pytest -n 4 armi

Submitting Changes
==================

To submit a change to ARMI, you will have to open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub.com.

The process for opening a PR against ARMI goes something like this:

1. `Fork the ARMI repo <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_
2. `Create a new branch <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository>`_ in your repo
3. Make your code changes to your new branch
4. Submit a Pull Request against `ARMIs main branch <https://github.com/terrapower/armi/pull/new/main>`_
    a. See `GitHubs general guidance on Pull Requests <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>`_
    b. See :doc:`ARMIs specific guidance </developer/tooling>` on what makes a "good" Pull Request.
5. Actively engage with your PR reviewer's questions and comments.

Licensing of Tools
==================

Be careful when including any dependency in ARMI (say in the ``pyproject.toml`` file) not
to include anything with a license that superceeds our Apache license. For instance,
any third-party Python library included in ARMI with a GPL license will make the whole
project fall under the GPL license. But a lot of potential users of ARMI will want to
keep some of their work private, so we can't allow any GPL tools.

For that reason, it is generally considered best-practice in the ARMI ecosystem to
only use third-party Python libraries that have MIT or BSD licenses.
