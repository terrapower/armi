Profiling ARMI
**************
Python in slow, so it's important to profile code to keep it running reasonbly quickly. Using the 
basic `Python profiler <https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html>`_ is the best way to get started. 
Once you have a ``.stats`` file, however, we highly recommend using a visualizer.  

The profiler visualizer `gprof2dot <http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/Gprof2Dot#Windows_users>`_
is an invaluable tool for taking a look at the profiler traces. You have to install graphvis also, which contains
the `dot` program.

The basic commands to run are::

    python -m gprof2dot -f pstats <mystatsfile>.stats | dot -Tpng -o <mydesiredimagename>.png

This produces images like this:
