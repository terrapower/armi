Tooling and infrastructure
==========================

Packaging and dependency management
-----------------------------------
The process of packaging Python projects and managing their dependencies is somewhat
challenging and nuanced. The contents of our ``setup.py`` follow existing conventions as
much as possible. In particular, we follow `this fantastic article
<https://caremad.io/posts/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/>`_ about dependecy management in
Python projects.

setup.py
^^^^^^^^
The packages listed in the ``install_requires`` argument to ``setup()`` are meant to
express, as abstractly as possible, the packages that need to be installed **somehow**
for the package to work. In addition, ``extras_require`` are used to specify other
packages that are not strictly required, but if installed enable extra functionality,
like unit testing or building documentation.

requirements.txt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``requirements***.txt`` files exist to describe a complete environment more
specifically. If specific versions of packages are required, they should be defined here.
Any extra arguments to ``pip`` will also be placed here. For instance, there is a ``-e``
that tells ``pip`` to install ARMI itself and defer to ``setup.py`` for a version-agnostic
list of dependencies. We also have multiple requirements files for different needs, like
testing.

Third-Party Licensing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Be careful when including any dependency in ARMI (say in a requirements.txt file) not
to include anything with a license that superceeds our Apache license. For instance,
any third-party Python library included in ARMI with a GPL license will make the whole
project fall under the GPL license. But a lot of potential users of ARMI will want to
keep some of their work private, so we can't allow any GPL tools.

For that reason, it is generally considered best-practice in the ARMI ecosystem to
only use third-party Python libraries that have MIT or BSD licenses.

Releasing a New Version of ARMI
-------------------------------
In ARMI, we use the common ``major.minor.bump`` version scheme where a version string
might look like ``0.1.7``, ``1.0.0``, or ``1.2.123``. Each number has a specific meaning:

* ``major`` - Revved for NRC-sanctioned release or at the end of a long development cycle.
* ``minor`` - Revved when we decide the code or our API has reached a stable point;
  this might happen once a year.
* ``bump`` - Revved every time we modify the API, or at will; any time we want.

**Any change to a major or minor version is considered a release.**

Only a core member of the ARMI team may release a new version, or add a tag of any kind to
the repository. The rule is *the only tags in the ARMI repo are for official versions*. If
you want to release a version of ARMI, you will need admin privileges to multiple TerraPower
repos on GitHub.

Every release should follow this process:

1. Ensure all unit tests pass and the documentation is building correctly.
2. Bump the ``__version__`` string in ``armi/meta.py``.
3. Add release notes to the documentation:
   `here <https://github.com/terrapower/armi/tree/master/doc/release>`__.
4. Tag the commit after it goes into the repo: ``git tag -a 1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"``
5. Also add the release notes on `the GitHub UI <https://github.com/terrapower/armi/releases>`__.
6. Follow the instructions `here <https://github.com/terrapower/terrapower.github.io>`_ to
   archive the new documentation.
7. Tell everyone!

Module-Level Logging
--------------------
In most of the modules in ``armi``, you will see logging using the ``runLog`` module.
This is a custom, global logging object provided by the import:

.. code-block:: python

    from armi import runLog

If you want a logger specific to a single module, say to provide debug logging for only
one module, that functionality is provided by what might look like a bare Python logging
import, but is actually calling the same underlying ``armi`` logging tooling:

.. code-block:: python

    import logging
    runLog = logging.getLogger(__name__)

In either case, you can then log using the same, easy interface:

.. code-block:: python

    runLog.info('information here')
    runLog.error('extra error info here')

Finally, you can change the logging level in either above scenario by doing:

.. code-block:: python

    runLog.setVerbosity(logging.DEBUG)
    # or
    runLog.setVerbosity('debug')
