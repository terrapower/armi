Entry Points
************

**Entry Points** are like the verbs that your App can *do*. The :py:mod:`built-in entry points <armi.cli>` offer basic
functionality, like :py:class:`running a case <armi.cli.run.RunEntryPoint>` or
:py:class:`opening up the GUI <armi.cli.gridGui.GridGuiEntryPoint>`, but the real joy of an application comes when you
add your own project-specific entry points that do the actions that you commonly need done.

To make a new EntryPoint, first make a new module and subclass :py:class:`~armi.cli.entryPoint.EntryPoint`. Set the
class attributes as follows:

``name``
    What the user types on the CLI to invoke this entry point.

``settingsArgument``

    * ``"required"`` if a settings input file must be provided,
    * ``"optional"`` if it may be provided but not required,
    * ``None`` if no settings input is allowed


.. tip:: ARMI apps often collect EntryPoints in a ``cli/`` directory (Command Line Interface)

Next, implement the :py:meth:`~armi.cli.entryPoint.EntryPoint.addOptions` method. Here you can both:

* turn various Settings into command-line arguments with :py:meth:`~armi.cli.entryPoint.EntryPoint.createOptionFromSetting`
* add arbitrary command-line arguments using the standard :py:mod:`python:argparse` library.

The values of the non-setting arguments will become attributes in ``self.args`` for later use.

Finally, implement the :py:meth:`~armi.cli.entryPoint.EntryPoint.invoke` method with the code you'd like to run upon
invocation of this entry point.


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Example entry point

    from armi import cases
    from armi.cli import entryPoint

    class SampleEntryPoint(entryPoint.EntryPoint):
        """
        Entry point title here.

        Long description of entry point here. This will get picked up and used as the help text on the command line!
        """

        name = "do-my-thing"
        settingsArgument = "required"

        def addOptions(self):
            self.createOptionFromSetting(CONF_CYCLE_LENGTH)
            self.createOptionFromSetting(CONF_BURN_STEPS)
            self.parser.add_argument(
                "--post-process",
                "-p",
                action="store_true",
                default=False,
                help="Just post-process an existing suite; don't run",
            )

        def invoke(self):
            inputCase = cases.Case(cs=self.cs)
            print(f"The case is {inputCase}")

            if self.args.post_process:
                print("Post processing...")


When you run your app, you will have this as an option, and you can invoke it with::

    python -m myapp do-my-thing --post-process settingsFile.yaml

or (if ``myapp`` is not in your ``PYTHONPATH``)::

    python path/to/myapp do-my-thing --post-process settingsFile.yaml

.. tip:: The settings file will be read into a ``Settings`` object. This ``Settings`` object will be passed widely
    around the code. Please do not edit these settings during a run. The idea of "run settings" is a lot simpler to
    understand when they don't change. And such changes tend to hide data from other developers.

To add entry points, ``ArmiPlugin``s can subclass the ``defineEntryPoints`` method. ARMI
has an extensive :py:class:`~armi.cli.EntryPointsPlugin` that comes with several CLI entry points. 
It is important to note that if you are building your own ARMI ``Application``, the
``EntryPointsPlugin`` must be registered to access these entry points either by registration in the application or 
subclassing :py:class:`~armi.apps.App`. If you do not want them or if you only want
some of them you can build your own list in a custom ``defineEntryPoints`` method.
