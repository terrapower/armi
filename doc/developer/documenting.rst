Documenting ARMI
================
ARMI uses the `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ documentation system to compile the 
web-based documentation from in-code docstrings and hand-created 
`ReStructedText files <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_.
This provides several benefits:
 
* We can revise and track the documentation in lock-step with the code itself, in the same 
  source code repository
* We can make use of hyperlinked cross-references that stay up to date as the code is expanded 
  or refactored.
* We can run specific code tests during documentation building to ensure the documentation 
  examples remain valid
* We can auto-generate class diagrams based on the latest status of the code

We use some special Sphinx plugins that run the tutorial jupyter notebooks during documentation
build with the most up-to-date code. 

Building the documentation
--------------------------
Before building documentation, ensure that you have installed the test requirements into
your ARMI virtual environment with::

    pip install -e .[test]

You also need to have the following utilities available in your PATH:

* `Graphviz <https://graphviz.org/>`_
* `Pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>`_

If you want to build the documentation into a PDF using the Sphinx LaTeX
builder, you also need:

* LaTeX (`MikTeX <https://miktex.org/>`_ on Windows)
* `ImageMagick <https://imagemagick.org/>`_

The documentation depends on at least one submodule as well, so you must be sure
it is available in your source tree with::

    git submodule update --init


To build the ARMI documentation as html, go to the ``doc`` folder and run::

    make html

This will invoke Sphinx and generate a series of html files in the
``_build/html`` folder. Open up ``index.html`` to see the documentation from
there. A copy of the documentation is hosted online at
https://terrapower.github.io/armi/.

You can suggest a change to the built documentation by copying the ``_build``
files to a clone of the `documentation repository
<https://github.com/terrapower/terrapower.github.io>`_ with a command like::

    rsync -ahv --delete _build/html/ path/to/terrapower.github.io/armi

Documentation for ARMI plugins
------------------------------
The following subsections apply to documentation for ARMI plugins.

Linking to ARMI documentation from plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ARMI plugin documentation can feature rich hyperlinks to the ARMI API
documentation with the help of the `intersphinx Sphinx plugin
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html>`_.  The
ARMI plugin documentation config file should add ``"sphinx.ext.intersphinx",``
to its active Sphinx plugin list, and change the default config to read::

    intersphinx_mapping = {
        "python": ("https://docs.python.org/3", None),
        "armi": ("https://terrapower.github.io/armi/", None),
    }

Now you can link to the ARMI documentation with links like::

    :doc:`armi:developer/documenting`
    :py:mod:`armi.physics.executers`


Automatically building apidocs of namespace packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Activating the ``"sphinxcontrib.apidoc",`` 
`Sphinx plugin <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/apidoc>`_
enables plugin API documentation to be built with the standard ``make html`` Sphinx workflow. If 
your ARMI plugin is a namespace package, the following extra config is required::

    apidoc_extra_args = ["--implicit-namespaces"]

Updating the Gallery
--------------------
The :doc:`ARMI example gallery </gallery/index>` is a great way to quickly
highlight neat features and uses of ARMI. To add a new item to the gallery, add
your example code (including the required docstring) to the ``doc/gallery-src``
folder in the ARMI source tree. The example will be added to the gallery during
the next documentation build.

Using Jupyter notebooks
-----------------------
For interactive tutorials, it's convenient to build actual Jupyter notebooks and 
commit them to the documentation to be rendered by Sphinx using the nbsphinx plugin.
When this is done, notebooks without any output should be committed to the repository
so that Sphinx actually executes the notebooks with the up-to-date code when the 
documentation is built. To do this, you can clean the output with::

    jupyter nbconvert --ClearOutputPreprocessor.enabled=True --inplace mynotebook.ipynb

This should clear the output and overwrite the file. If this doesn't work, you can clear
all output cells in the notebook web interface itself before committing the file.
