===========
Release Date: TBD

What's new in ARMI
------------------
#. Added neutronics settings: ``inners`` and ``outers`` for downstream support.
#. Removed unused Thermal Hydraulics settings.
#. Minor code re-org, moving math utilities into their own module.
#. Removed the ``PyYaml`` dependency.
#. Removed all bare ``import armi`` statements, for code clarity.
#. Renamed control rod assembly parameters for generic implementations of control rod handling.
#. TBD

Bug fixes
---------
#. Supporting swapping assemblies with different block meshes in ``_swapFluxParam``.
#. Fixed issues finding ``ISOXX`` files cross-platform.
#. Fixed issue with docs not correctly loading their Git submodule in TOX.
#. Fixed issue with ``_swapFluxParams`` failing for assemblies with different blocks (`#566 <https://github.com/terrapower/armi/issues/566>`_)
#. Multiple bug fixes in ``growToFullCore``.
#. ``Block.getWettedPerim`` was moved to ``HexBlock``, as that was more accurate.
#. ``pathTools.cleanPath()`` is not much more linear, and handles the MPI use-case better.
