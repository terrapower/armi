ARMI v0.1 Release Notes
=======================

ARMI v0.1.0
===========
Release Date: 2019-10-31

Initial public release.

ARMI v0.1.1
===========
Release Date: 2019-11-15

User-facing enhancements
------------------------
* Added C5G7 sample LWR inputs
* Slightly improved installation documentation
* Improved ability to input subassembly geometric details by adding
  grid definitions to blueprints files
* Demoted ``mpi4py`` to an optional requirement to ease installation
  process.

Backend changes
---------------
* Removed need for geometry object for Reactor construction
* Pushed symmetry and geomType metadata onto spatialGrids
* Turned off auto-conversion of HDF5 DBs to a previous format

ARMI v0.1.2
===========
Release Date: 2019-11-16

Hotfixes
--------
* Fixed dependency issue with pympler

ARMI v0.1.3
===========
Release Date: 2020-02-25

User-facing enhancements
------------------------
* Improved flexibility of nuclide flags input by adding an ``expandTo`` section so
  users can control precisely which isotopes the elements get expanded into.
* Improved migration system, accessible with ``python -m armi migrate-inputs``
* Added new material modifications for inputting fuels made of mixtures of two custom
  isotopic vectors.
* Add YAML ``!include`` support to blueprints files.
* Remove ``latticeFile`` section to grid blueprints.
* Allow modification of linked dimentions in ``SuiteBuilder``.

Bugfixes
--------
* SuiteBuilder handles smear density dimension changes for parameter sweeps again
* Fixed broken documentation printout of Flags.
* Ensure that Cases do not think of themselves as their own dependencies.

Backend changes
---------------
* Number fractions are now maintained across elemental expansion subsets. This slightly
  changes the isotopic composition when, for example, Tungsten is expanded to 4 out of
  the 5 natural isotopes.
* Add BOL HM mass block parameter.
* Add support for custom parameter serializers for database interaction.
* Formalize Flag reading and writing from/to the database.
* Improve handling of large HDF5 attributes in Database3.
