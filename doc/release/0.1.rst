ARMI v0.1 Release Notes
=======================

ARMI v0.1.0
===========
Release Date: 2019-10-31

Initial public release.

ARMI v0.1.1
===========
Release Date: 2019-11-15

User-facing enhancements
------------------------
* Added C5G7 sample LWR inputs
* Slightly improved installation documentation
* Improved ability to input subassembly geometric details by adding
  grid definitions to blueprints files
* Demoted ``mpi4py`` to an optional requirement to ease installation
  process.

Backend changes
---------------
* Removed need for geometry object for Reactor construction
* Pushed symmetry and geomType metadata onto spatialGrids
* Turned off auto-conversion of HDF5 DBs to a previous format

ARMI v0.1.2
===========
Release Date: 2019-11-16

Hotfixes
--------
* Fixed dependency issue with pympler

ARMI v0.1.3
===========
Release Date: 2020-02-25

User-facing enhancements
------------------------
* Improved flexibility of nuclide flags input by adding an ``expandTo`` section so
  users can control precisely which isotopes the elements get expanded into.
* Improved migration system, accessible with ``python -m armi migrate-inputs``
* Added new material modifications for inputting fuels made of mixtures of two custom
  isotopic vectors.
* Add YAML ``!include`` support to blueprints files.
* Remove ``latticeFile`` section to grid blueprints.
* Allow modification of linked dimentions in ``SuiteBuilder``.

Bugfixes
--------
* SuiteBuilder handles smear density dimension changes for parameter sweeps again
* Fixed broken documentation printout of Flags.
* Ensure that Cases do not think of themselves as their own dependencies.

Backend changes
---------------
* Number fractions are now maintained across elemental expansion subsets. This slightly
  changes the isotopic composition when, for example, Tungsten is expanded to 4 out of
  the 5 natural isotopes.
* Add BOL HM mass block parameter.
* Add support for custom parameter serializers for database interaction.
* Formalize Flag reading and writing from/to the database.
* Improve handling of large HDF5 attributes in Database3.


ARMI v0.1.4
===========
Release Date: 2020-02-27

Bugfixes
--------
* Fix minor output date/time bug.
* Copy Interface inputs in a manner constistent with standard inputs when cloning Cases.


ARMI v0.1.5
===========
Release Date: 2020-10-15

User-facing enhancements
------------------------
* Add location-based history tracking to Database3.
* Add grid-editor GUI (``grids`` entry point).
* Add support for converting Database files to general-purpose visualization formats
  (currently supported are VTK and XDMF).
* Add generic fuel-performance plugin.
* Update Hastelloy N and Incoloy 800 materials.
* Add holed rectangle, square component types.
* Add ``syncDbAfterWrite`` setting.
* Add support for explicit Flags input in Blueprints.
* Add glob option to directory changer file retrieval.
* Add Cartesian plotting capabilities.
* Add support for importing unstablie nuclides from the RIPL-3 database.
* Numerous documentation and tutorial enhancements.
* Add ``run-suite`` entry point.
* Improve/generalize and make extensible from Plugins the setting rename capability.
* Improve merging behavior of GAMISO and PMATRX files.
* Add ``doTH`` setting.
* Add ``mpiActionRequiresReset`` plugin hook.
* Remove unused entry points (``back-up-db``, ``copy-db``).
* Add thermal-scattering metadata to materials.
* Improve ASCII map capabilities.
* Add the ability to define ex-core Core-like structures in blueprints. This is good for
  things like spent-fuel pools.
* Minor improvements to ``SuiteBuilder``.

Bugfixes
--------
* Fix issues in uniform mesh conversion.
* Fix order-of-operations issues with string-to-Flags conversions.
* Fix issues with circular ring hex-to-RZ mesh conversion.
* Fix bug in HT9 material, which was not properly converting between C and K.

Backend changes
---------------
* Better-formalize Executer classes.
* Improve consistency global flux code.
* Various performance enhancements.
* Add packing/unpacking of Multi-Index Locations in the database.
* Remove deprecated old Settings.
* Remove armiAbsDirFromName.
* Reduce numerical diffusion in mesh mapping operations.
* No longer auto-apply DEPLETABLE Flag when flags explicitly specified.
* Improve behavior of delated neutron fraction settings and parameter values.
* Change assembly ordering to be based on (i, j) indices rather than (ring, pos).
* Remove ``Block.getEnrichment()``, since it is redundant with the ``Composite``
  version.
* Remove old block-homogenized number density params. These are still whipped up on the
  fly when writing to DB.
* Add explicit ``CartesianGrid`` class.
* Remove some unused or design- and physics-related functions from ``Block``.
* Merge ``addComponent()`` with base ``add()``.
* Fix issues with Be material properties.
* Allow setting ``Block`` heights to zero.
* Add a Setting class for handling lists of Flags.
* Greatly improve support for CCCC file reading/writing.


ARMI v0.1.6
===========
Release Date: TBD

* Removed ``dumpLocationSnapshot`` setting and related functionality. This is replaced
  by features of Database, version 3. Database 3 supports history tracking from the
  database file, and whole reactor models can be loaded for any stored time step,
  obviating the need for special logic in snapshots.

* Added capability to map flags to current meaning when loading from database.
  Previously, loading would fail if the meanings of written and current flags did not
  match exactly.
