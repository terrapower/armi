# N801 - Class name should use CapWords convention
# SIM - code simplification rules
# TID - tidy imports

# Ruff rules we ignore (for now) because they are not 100% automatable
#
# D100 - Missing docstring in public module
# D101 - Missing docstring in public class
# D102 - Missing docstring in public method
# D103 - Missing docstring in public function
# D106 - Missing docstring in public nested class
# D401 - First line of docstring should be in imperative mood
# D404 - First word of the docstring should not be "This"
# SIM102 - Use a single if statement instead of nested if statements
# SIM105 - Use contextlib.suppress({exception}) instead of try-except-pass
# SIM108 - Use ternary operator {contents} instead of if-else-block
# SIM114 - Combine if branches using logical or operator
# SIM115 - Use context handler for opening files
# SIM117 - Use a single with statement with multiple contexts instead of nested with statements

# Ruff rules we ignore because we don't want them
#
# D105 - we don't need to document well-known magic methods
# D205 - 1 blank line required between summary line and description
# E501 - line length, because we use Black for that
# E731 - we can use lambdas however we want
# RUF100 - no unused noqa statements (not consistent enough yet)
# SIM118 - this does not work where we overload the .keys() method
