"""
Per-directory pytest plugin configuration used only during development/testing.

This is a used to manipulate the environment under which pytest runs the unit tests. This
can act as a one-stop-shop for manipulating the sys.path. This can be used to set paths
when using the ARMI framework as a submodule in a larger project.

Tests must be invoked via pytest for this to have any affect, for example::

    $ pytest -n6 framework/armi
