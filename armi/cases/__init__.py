Case and CaseSuite objects for running and analyzing ARMI cases.

A ``Case`` is a collection of inputs that represents one particular run.
Cases have special knowledge about dependencies and can perform useful
operations like compare, clone, and run.

A ``CaseSuite`` is a set of (often related) Cases. These are fundamental to 
parameter sweeps and test suites. 

See Also
--------
armi.cli : Entry points that build Cases and/or CaseSuites and send them off to
    do work

armi.operators : Operations that ARMI will perform on a reactor model.
    Generally these are made by an individual Case.

Examples
--------
Create a Case and run it::

    case = Case(settings.Settings('path-to-settings.yaml'))
    case.run()

    # do something with output database

Create a case suite from existing files, and run the suite::

    cs = settings.Settings() # default settings
    suite = CaseSuite(settings.Settings()) # default settings
    suite.discover('my-cases*.yaml', recursive=True)
    suite.run()
    
.. warning: Suite running may not work yet if the cases have interdependencies.

Create a ``burnStep`` sensitivity study from some base CS::

    baseCase = Case(settings.Settings('base-settings.yaml')) # default settings
    suite = CaseSuite(baseCase.cs) # basically just sets armiLocation

    for numSteps in range(3, 11):
        with ForcedCreationDirectoryChanger('{}steps'.format(numSteps)):
            case = baseCase.clone(title=baseCase.title + '-with{}steps'.format(numSteps),
                                  settings={'burnSteps': numSteps})
            suite.add(case)

    suite.writeInputs()
    
Then submit the inputs to your HPC cluster.
