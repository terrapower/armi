The ``Case`` object is responsible for running, and executing a set of user inputs.  Many
entry points redirect into ``Case`` methods, such as ``clone``, ``compare``, and ``run``

The ``Case`` object provides an abstraction around ARMI inputs to allow for manipulation and
collection of cases.

    Copy sets of files that are considered "input" from each active interface.

    This enables developers to add new inputs in a plugin-dependent/ modular way.

    In parameter sweeps, these often have a sourceDir associated with them that is
    different from the cs.inputDirectory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cs : CaseSettings
        The source case settings to find input files

    destination: str
        The target directory to copy input files to

    sourceDir: str, optional
        The directory from which to copy files. Defaults to cs.inputDirectory

    Notes
    -----

    This may seem a bit overly complex, but a lot of the behavior is important. Relative
    paths are copied into the target directory, which in some cases requires updating
    the setting that pointed to the file in the first place. This is necessary to avoid
    case dependencies in relavive locations above the input directory, which can lead to
    issues when cloneing case suites. In the future this could be simplified by adding a
    concept for a suite root directory, below which it is safe to copy files without
    needing to update settings that point with a relative path to files that are below
    it.
