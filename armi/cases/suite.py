The ``CaseSuite`` object is responsible for running, and executing a set of user inputs.  Many
entry points redirect into ``CaseSuite`` methods, such as ``clone``, ``compare``, and ``submit``

Used in conjunction with the :py:class:`~armi.cases.case.Case` object, ``CaseSuite`` can 
be used to collect a series of cases
and submit them to a cluster for execution. Furthermore, a ``CaseSuite`` can be used to gather
executed cases for post-analysis.

``CaseSuite``\ s should allow ``Cases`` to be added from totally separate directories.
This is useful for plugin-informed in-use testing as well as other things.

        By design, a CaseSuite has no location dependence; this allows any set of cases
        to compose a CaseSuite. The thought is that the post-analysis capabilities
        without restricting a root directory could be beneficial. For example, this
        allows one to perform analysis on cases analyzed by Person A and Person B, even
        if the analyses were performed in completely different locations. As a
        consequence, when you want to clone, we need to infer a "root" of the original
        cases to attempt to mirror whatever existing directory structure there may have
