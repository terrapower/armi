Module to read DLAYXS files, which contain delayed neutron precursor data, including decay constants and emission
spectra.

Similar to ISOTXS files, DLAYXS files are often created by a lattice physics code such as MC2 and used as input
to a global flux solver such as DIF3D.

This module implements reading and writing of the DLAYXS, consistent with [CCCC-IV]_.

        Since some nuclides do not have their own data (like Pu242),
        the nuclide shares data with other nuclides. This mapping is done via
        the nuclideFamilies attribute.

        Notes
        -----
        Long ago, the DLAYXS file had the same constants for each nuclide (!?) and this method
        simply took the first. Later, it was updated to take an importance- and abundance-weighted
        average of the values on the DLAYXS library.

        A paper by Tuttle (1974) discusses some averaging but they end up saying that kinetics problems
        are mostly insensitive to the group constants ("errors of a few percent"). But in TWRs, we switch from U235 to Pu239
        and the difference may be important. We can try weighting by nuclide effective
        delayed neutron fractions beta_eff_nuclide/beta.
