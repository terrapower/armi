    .. warning::
        This class was originally written for DIF3D-Nodal, and so it is not currently set
        up to read all content of a DIF3D-VARIANT NHFLUX file; specifically, it cannot read
        the odd-parity flux moments and partial current moments beyond the zeroth-order.

        DIF3D outputs NHFLUX at every time node, but REBUS outputs NHFLUX only at every cycle.

    Attributes
    ----------
    metadata : file control
        The NHFLUX file control info (sort of global for this library). This is the contents
        of the 1D data block on the file.

    incomingPointersToAllAssemblies: 2-D list of floats
        This is an index map for the "internal surfaces" between DIF3D nodal
        indexing and DIF3D GEODST indexing. It can be used to process incoming partial
        currents. This uses the same ordering as the geodstCoordMap attribute.

    externalCurrentPointers : list of ints
        This is an index map for the "external surfaces" between DIF3D nodal
        indexing and DIF3D GEODST indexing. "External surfaces" are important because they
        contain the INCOMING partial currents from the outer reactor boundary. This uses
        the same ordering as geodstCoordMap, except that each assembly now has multiple
        subsequent indices. For example, for a hexagonal core, if hex of index n (0 to N-1)
        has a surface of index k (0 to 5) that lies on the vacuum boundary, then the index
        of that surface is N*6 + k + 1.

    geodstCoordMap : list of ints
        This is an index map between DIF3D nodal and DIF3D GEODST. It is
        necessary for interpreting the ordering of flux and partial current data in the
        NHFLUX file. Note that this mapping between DIF3D-Nodal and DIF3D-VARIANT is not
        the same.

    outgoingPCSymSeCPointers: list of ints
        This is an index map for the outpgoing partial currents on the symmetric and sector
        lateral boundary. It is only present for DIF3D-VARIANT for hexagonal cores.

    ingoingPCSymSeCPointers: list of ints
        This is an index map for the ingoing (or incoming) partial currents on the symmetric
        and sector lateral boundary. It is only present for DIF3D-VARIANT for hexagonal cores.

    fluxMoments : 4-D list of floats
        This contains all the flux moments for all core assemblies. The jth planar flux moment
        of assembly i in group g in axial node k is fluxMoments[i][k][j][g]. The
        assemblies are ordered according to the geodstCoordMap attribute.

    partialCurrentsHex : 4-D list of floats
        This contains all the OUTGOING partial currents for all core assemblies. The OUTGOING
        partial current on surface j in assembly i in axial node k in group g is
        partialCurrentsHex[i][k][j][g]. The assemblies are ordered according to the
        geodstCoordMap attribute.

    partialCurrentsHex_ext : 3-D list of floats
        This contains all the INCOMING partial currents on "external surfaces", which are
        adjacent to the reactor outer boundary (usually vacuum). Internal reflective surfaces
        are NOT included in this! These "external surfaces" are ordered according to
        externalCurrentPointers.

    partialCurrentsZ : 4-D list of floats
        This contains all the upward and downward partial currents for all core assemblies
        The assemblies are ordered according to the geodstCoordMap attribute.

        r"""
        Read/write multigroup lateral partial OUTGOING currents from the NHFLUX 4D block.

        This reads all OUTGOING partial currents for all assembly block lateral surfaces
        at a fixed axial position. For a hexagonal core, there are 6 surfaces per assembly
        axial block. The data for the 2 axial surfaces of each block are in the 5D records.

        Each 4D record contains all the surface partial currents on ONE x,y plane. The
        surface data on different x,y planes (different axial slices) are in a different
        4D record, so this method must be repeatedly executed in order to process them all.

        If the reactor contains N assemblies and M exterior surfaces (surfaces adjacent to
        vacuum boundary), this record will contain N*6 + M partial currents. The N*6
        assembly OUTGOING partial currents are listed first, followed by the M INCOMING
        partial currents from the outer reactor edge.

        N = self._metadata['nintxy']
        M = self._metadata['npcxy'] - self._metadata['nintxy']*6
        N*6 + M = self._metadata['npcxy']

        Note that only the first set of entries is processed. The number of sets is identified
        by the "nscoef" metadata. All other sets are discarded. For VARIANT, this means
        that moments above the zeroth-order are discarded.

        Notes
        -----
        These data are harder to read with rwMatrix, though it could be done if we
        discarded the unwanted data at another level if that is much faster.

        Read/write multigroup axial partial currents from the NHFLUX 5D block.

        Most other NHFLUX data is indexed by DIF3D node (each axial core slice in its own record).
        HOWEVER, "top" and "bottom" surfaces of each DIF3D node are instead indexed by axial
        surface. If there are Z axial nodes, then there are Z+1 axial surfaces. Thus, there
        are Z+1 5D records, while there are only Z 3D and Z 4D records.

        Each 5D record (each axial surface) contains two partial currents for each assembly position.
        The first is the UPWARD partial current, while the second is the DOWNWARD partial current.
