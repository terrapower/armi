Read and write the Regular Total flux from a RTFLUX CCCC interface file.

RTFLUX is a CCCC standard data file for storing multigroup total flux on a mesh of any
geometry type. It is defined in [CCCC-IV]_.

ATFLUX is in the same format but holds adjoint flux rather than regular flux.

Examples
--------
>>> flux = rtflux.RtfluxStream.readBinary("RTFLUX")
>>> rtflux.RtfluxStream.writeBinary(flux, "RTFLUX2")
>>> adjointFlux = rtflux.AtfluxStream.readBinary("ATFLUX")
