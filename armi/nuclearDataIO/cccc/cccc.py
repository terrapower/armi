    A single CCCC record.

    Reads or writes information to or from a stream.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stream
        A collection of data to be read or written

    hasRecordBoundaries : bool
        A True value means the fortran file was written using access='sequential' and contains
        a 4 byte int count at the beginning and end of each record. Otherwise, if False the
        fortran file was written using access='direct'.

    Notes
    -----
    The methods in this object often have `rw` prefixes, meaning the same method
    can be used for both reading and writing. We consider this a significant
    achievement that enforces consistency between the code for reading and writing
    CCCC records. The tradeoff is that it's a bit challenging to comprehend at first.

    Return block bandwidth JL, JU from CCCC interface files.

    It is common for CCCC files to block data in various records with
    a description along the lines of::

        WITH M AS THE BLOCK INDEX, JL=(M-1)*((NINTJ-1)/NBLOK +1)+1
        AND JU=MIN0(NINTJ,JUP) WHERE JUP=M*((NINTJ-1)/NBLOK +1)

    This function computes JL and JU for these purposes. It also converts
    JL and JU to zero based indices rather than 1 based ones, as is almost
    always wanted when dealing with python/numpy matrices.

    The term *bandwidth* refers to a kind of sparse matrix representation.
    Some rows only have columns JL to JH in them rather than 0 to JMAX.
    The non-zero band from JL to JH is what we're talking about here.
