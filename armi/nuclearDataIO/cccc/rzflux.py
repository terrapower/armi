Module for reading/writing RZFLUX CCCC interface files.

RZFLUX contains Regular Zone Flux, or multigroup flux by neutron energy group
in each zone. It also can hold some convergence and neutron balance information.

The format is defined in [CCCC-IV]_.

Examples
--------
>>> flux = rzflux.readBinary("RZFLUX")
>>> flux.groupFluxes[2, 0] *= 1.1
>>> rzflux.writeBinary(flux, "RZFLUX2")
>>> rzflux.writeAscii(flux, "RZFLUX2.ascii")
