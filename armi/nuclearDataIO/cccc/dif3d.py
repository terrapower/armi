            :id: I_ARMI_NUCDATA_DIF3D
            :implements: R_ARMI_NUCDATA_DIF3D

            The reading and writing of the DIF3D binary file is performed using
            :py:class:`StreamWithDataContainer <.cccc.StreamWithDataContainer>`
            from the :py:mod:`~armi.nuclearDataIO.cccc` package. This class
            allows for the reading and writing of CCCC binary files, processing
            one record at a time using subclasses of the :py:class:`IORecord
            <.cccc.IORecord>`. Each record in a CCCC binary file consists of
            words that represent integers (short or long), floating-point
            numbers (single or double precision), or strings of data. One or
            more of these words are parsed one at a time by the reader. Multiple
            words processed together have meaning, such as such as groupwise
            overrelaxation factors. While reading, the data is stored in a
            Python dictionary as an attribute on the object, one for each
            record. The keys in each dictionary represent the parsed grouping of
            words in the records; for example, for the 4D record (stored as the
            attribute ``fourD``), each groupwise overrelaxation factor is stored
            as the key ``OMEGA{i}``, where ``i`` is the group number. See
            :need:`I_ARMI_NUCDATA` for more details on the general
            implementation.

            Each record is also embedded with the record size at the beginning
            and end of the record (always assumed to be present), which is used
            for error checking at the end of processing each record.

            The DIF3D reader processes the file identification record (stored as
            the attribute ``_metadata``) and the five data records for the DIF3D
            file, as defined in the specification for the file distributed with
            the DIF3D software.

            This class can also read and write an ASCII version of the DIF3D
            file. While this format is not used by the DIF3D software, it can be
            a useful representation for users to access the file in a
            human-readable format.
