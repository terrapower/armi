FIXSRC is a CCCC standard data file for storing multigroup fixed sources on a triangular mesh.

Currently, the FIXSRC writing capability assumes a gamma (not neutron) fixed source problem.
This enables photon transport problems. [CCCC-IV]_

        Initialize a gamma FIXSRC class for reading or writing a binary FIXSRC file for DIF3D gamma fixed source input.
        If the intent is to write a gamma FIXSRC file, the variable FIXSRC.fixSrc, which contains to-be-written
        core-wide multigroup gamma fixed source data, is constructed from an existing neutron RTFLUX file.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fileName : str, optional
            The file name of the RTFLUX/ATFLUX binary file to be read.

        fileMode : str, optional
            If 'wb', this class writes a FIXSRC binary file.
            If 'rb', this class reads a preexisting FIXSRC binary file.

        o : Operator object, optional
            If fileMode='wb', an ARMI operator must be specified in order to construct gamma fixed source data
            from a neutron RTFLUX file (requires reactor geometry and settings).
