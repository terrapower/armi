Cross section collections contain cross sections for a single nuclide or region.

Specifically, they are used as attributes of :py:class:`~armi.nuclearDataIO.xsNuclides.XSNuclide`, which
then are combined as a :py:class:`~armi.nuclearDataIO.xsLibraries.XSLibrary`.

These may represent microscopic or macroscopic neutron or photon cross sections. When they are macroscopic,
they generally represent a whole region with many nuclides, though this is not required.
