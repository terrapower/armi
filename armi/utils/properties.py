    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Name of the property. This is unfortunately necessary, because the method does not know the name of
        the property being assigned by the developer.

    dependencyAction : str
        Description of an action that needs to be performed in order to set the value of the property.

    doc : str
        Docstring of the property.

    42.1
