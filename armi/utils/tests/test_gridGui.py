Tests for gridEditor.py.

By default, this would open the app in your primary display and steal control from your mouse and keyboard while the
test is running. This means that if your display is smaller than 1000 x 1000, or if you move your mouse when the test is
running, the test might fail even when things are fine.

These issues can be resolved by running the test in a virtual display. To do so, `pip install pytest-xvfb`,
and run `pytest test_gridGui.py` as usual. If you wish to change the resolution of the virtual display, you can modify
the `xvfb_width` and `xvfb_height` in `pytest.ini`.

After you have installed pytest-xvfb, you will no longer see the app displayed on your screen, which can make debugging
harder. Thus, during debugging, you may want the app to appear on your display by setting the `--no-xvfb` flag, and
have the print statements print to your console by setting the `--capture=tee-sys` flag, like this:
```
pytest --no-xvfb --capture=tee-sys test_gridGui.py
```

Note:
These tests currently require a rather specific environment:
1. wxPython needs to be installed, and
2. The test needs to run in a pure X11 environment (doesn't work in Wayland or XWayland, unfortunately).
To check if you are in an X11 environment, run this command:
```
loginctl list-sessions --no-legend | \
  cut --delimiter=' ' --field=1 | \
  xargs loginctl show-session --property=Type --value
```
If it outputs "x11", it should work (and if it outputs "wayland", it probably won't, for now).
