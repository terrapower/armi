def resolveMarkupInclusions(
    src: Union[TextIO, pathlib.Path], root: Optional[pathlib.Path] = None
) -> io.StringIO:
    r"""
    Process a text stream, appropriately handling ``!include`` tags.

    This will take the passed IO stream or file path, replacing any instances of
    ``!include [path]`` with the appropriate contents of the ``!include`` file.

    What is returned is a new text stream, containing the contents of all of the files
    stitched together.

    Parameters
    ----------
    src : StringIO or TextIOBase/Path
        If a Path is provided, read text from there. If is stream is provided, consume
        text from the stream. If a stream is provided, ``root`` must also be provided.
    root : Optional Path
        The root directory to use for resolving relative paths in !include tags. If a
        stream is provided for ``src``, ``root`` must be provided. Otherwise, the
        directory containing the ``src`` path will be used by default.

    Notes
    -----
    While the use of ``!include`` appears as though it would invoke some sort of special
    custom YAML constructor code, this does not do that. Processing these inclusions as
    part of the document parsing/composition that comes with ruamel.yaml could
    work, but has a number of prohibitive drawbacks (or at least reasons why it might
    not be worth doing). Using a custom constructor is more-or-less supported by
    ruamel.yaml (which we do use, as it is what underpins the yamlize package), but it
    carries limitations about how anchors and aliases can cross included-file
    boundaries. Getting around this requires either monkey-patching ruamel.yaml, or
    subclassing it, which in turn would require monkey-patching yamlize.

    Instead, we treat the ``!include``\ s as a sort of pre-processor directive, which
    essentially pastes the contents of the ``!include``\ d file into the location of the
    ``!include``. The result is a text stream containing the entire contents, with all
    ``!include``\ s resolved. The only degree of sophistication lies in how indentation
    is handled; since YAML cares about indentation to keep track of object hierarchy,
    care must be taken that the included file contents are indented appropriately.

    To precisely describe how the indentation works, it helps to have some definitions:

     - Included file: The file specified in the ``!include [Included file]``
     - Including line: The line that actually contains the ``!include [Included file]``
     - Meaningful YAML content: Text in a YAML file that is not either indentation or a
       special character like "-", ":" or "?".

    The contents of the included file will be indented such that that the first
    character of each line in the included file will be found at the first column in the
    including line that contains meaningful YAML content. The only exception is the
    first line of the included file, which starts at the location of the ``!include``
    itself and is not deliberately indented.

    In the future, we may wish to do the more sophisticated processing of the
    ``!include``\ s as part of the YAML parse. For future reference, there is some pure
    gold on that topic here:
