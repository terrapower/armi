"""
A Flag class, similar to ``enum.Flag``.

This is an alternate implementation of the standard-library ``enum.Flag`` class. We use
this to implement :py:class:`armi.reactor.flags.Flags`. We used to use the
standard-library implementation, but that became limiting when we wanted to make it
possible for plugins to define their own flags; the standard implementation does not
support extension. We also considered the ``aenum`` package, which permits extension of
``Enum`` classes, but unfortunately does not support extension of ``Flags``. So, we had to
make our own. This is a much simplified version of what comes with ``aenum``, but still
provides most of the safety and functionality.

There is an `issue <https://bitbucket.org/stoneleaf/aenum/issues/27/>`_ on the ``aenum``
bitbucket site to track ``Flag`` extension.
