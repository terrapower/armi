Custom materials are ones that you can specify all the number densities yourself.

Useful for benchmarking when you have a particular specified material density.
Use the isotopic input described in :doc:`/user/inputs/blueprints`.

The density function gets applied from custom isotopics by
:py:meth:`armi.reactor.blueprints.isotopicOptions.CustomIsotopic.apply`.
