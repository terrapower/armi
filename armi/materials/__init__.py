The material package defines compositions and material-specific properties.

Properties in scope include temperature dependent thermo/mechanical properties
(like heat capacity, linear expansion coefficients, viscosity, density),
and material-specific nuclear properties that can't exist at the nuclide level
alone (like :py:mod:`thermal scattering laws <armi.nucDirectory.thermalScattering>`).

As the fundamental macroscopic building blocks of any physical object,
these are highly important to reactor analysis.

This module handles the dynamic importing of all the materials defined here at the
framework level as well as in all the attached plugins. It is expected that most teams
will have special material definitions that they will want to define.

It may also make sense in the future to support user-input materials that are not
hard-coded into the app.

The base class for all materials is in :py:mod:`armi.materials.material`.

        An ARMI application will need materials. Materials can be imported from
        any code the application has access to, like plugin packages. This leads to
        the situation where one ARMI application will want to import multiple
        collections of materials. To handle this, ARMI keeps a list of material
        namespaces. This is an ordered list of importable packages that ARMI
        can search for a particular material by name.

        This automatic exploration of an importable package saves the user the
        tedium have having to import or include hundreds of materials manually somehow.
        But it comes with a caveat; the list is ordered. If two different namespaces in
        the list include a material with the same name, the first one found in the list
        is chosen, i.e. earlier namespaces in the list have precedence.

    """
    Find the first material class that matches a name in an ordered namespace.

    Names can either be fully resolved class paths (e.g. ``armi.materials.uZr:UZr``)
    or simple class names (e.g. ``UZr``). In the latter case, the
    ``CONF_MATERIAL_NAMESPACE_ORDER`` setting to allows users to choose which
    particular material of a common name (like UO2 or HT9) gets used.

    Input files usually specify a material like UO2. Which particular implementation
    gets used (Framework's UO2 vs. a user plugins UO2 vs. the Kentucky Transportation
    Cabinet's UO2) is up to the user at runtime.

    .. impl:: Materials can be searched across packages in a defined namespace.
        :id: I_ARMI_MAT_NAMESPACE
        :implements: R_ARMI_MAT_NAMESPACE

        During the runtime of an ARMI application, but particularly during the
        construction of the reactor in memory, materials will be requested by name. At
        that point, this code is called to search for that material name. The search
        goes through the ordered list of Python namespaces provided. The first time an
        instance of that material is found, it is returned. In this way, the first
        items in the material namespace list take precedence.

        When a material name is passed to this function, it may be either a simple
        name like the string ``"UO2"`` or it may be much more specific, like
        ``armi.materials.uraniumOxide:UO2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        The material class name to find, e.g. ``"UO2"``. Optionally, a module path
        and class name can be provided with a colon separator as ``module:className``,
        e.g. ``armi.materials.uraniumOxide:UO2`` for direct specification.
    namespaceOrder : list of str, optional
        A list of namespaces in order of preference in which to search for the
        material. If not passed, the value in the global ``MATERIAL_NAMESPACE_ORDER``
        will be used, which is often set by the ``CONF_MATERIAL_NAMESPACE_ORDER``
        setting (e.g. during reactor construction). Any value passed into this argument
        will be ignored if the ``name`` is provided with a ``modulePath``.

    Returns
    -------
    matCls : armi.materials.material.Material
        The material

    Raises
    ------
    KeyError
        When material of name cannot be found in namespaces.

    --------
