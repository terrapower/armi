    """
    Homogenized mixture of materials.

    .. warning:: This class is meant to be used for homogenized block models for neutronics and other
       physics solvers.

    Notes
    -----
    This material class can be used to represent a homognized mixture of materials within a block.
    This would be done for performance reasons. It allows ARMI to avoid copying and carrying around
    the detailed, explicit representation of components within a block to be used in a physics solver
    when that solver only needs to know the homogenized number density within a block.
