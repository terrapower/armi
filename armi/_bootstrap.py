# Nuclide bases get built explicitly here to have better determinism
# about when they get instantiated. The burn chain is not applied
# at this point, but only after input is read. Nuclides need to be built super early
# because some import-time code needs them to function. Namely, Block parameter
# collection uses them to create number density params.
