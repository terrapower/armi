This defines a Settings object that acts mostly like a dictionary. It
is meant to be treated mostly like a singleton, where each custom ARMI
object has access to it. It contains global user settings like the core
power level, the input file names, the number of cycles to run, the run type,
the environment setup, and hundreds of other things.

A settings object can be saved as or loaded from an YAML file. The ARMI GUI is designed to
create this settings file, which is then loaded by an ARMI process on the cluster.

A primary case settings is created as ``masterCs``
