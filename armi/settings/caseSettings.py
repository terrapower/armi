This defines a Settings object that acts mostly like a dictionary. It
is meant so that each ARMI run has one-and-only-one Settings object. It records
user settings like the core power level, the input file names, the number of cycles to
run, the run type, the environment setup, and hundreds of other things.

A Settings object can be saved as or loaded from an YAML file. The ARMI GUI is designed to
create this settings file, which is then loaded by an ARMI process on the cluster.
