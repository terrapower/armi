"""
This module contains rules supporting custom actions taken on the reading of setting inputs

Note
----
The ``settingsRules`` system was developed before the pluginification of ARMI, and
doesn't play very nicely with the post-plugin world. This is mainly because
registration of new rules happens at import time of the rule itself, which is
unreliable and difficult to control, and even sort of implicit and sneaky. They are
also somewhat redundant with the
:py:class:`armi.operators.settingsValidation.Query`/:py:class:`armi.operators.settingsValidation.Inspector`
system and the ``scripts.migration`` package.. It is not recommended for plugins to define 
settings rules using the mechanism
in this module, which may be removed in the future.
