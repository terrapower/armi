# A simple test reactor, not physicially functional
#
# * pin-type reactor with hex assemblies
# * sodium-cooled, fast
# * full core symmetry
# * The core grid is corners up
# * The symmetric core positions have different assembly types
# * The different assembly types have different amounts of molesHmBOL because they had different TD_frac material modifications
# * There are 3 rings (necessary for checking problems with symmetry because the assemblies in the 2nd ring don't actually fall along the symmetry line that is checked)
