The base ARMI App class.

This module defines the :py:class:`App` class, which is used to configure the ARMI
Framework for a specific application. An ``App`` implements a simple interface for
customizing much of the Framework's behavior.

.. admonition:: Historical Fun Fact

    This pattern is used by many frameworks as a way of encapsulating what would
    otherwise be global state. The ARMI Framework has historically made heavy use of
    global state (e.g., :py:mod:`armi.nucDirectory.nuclideBases`), and it will take
    quite a bit of effort to refactor the code to access such things through an App
    object. We are planning to do this, but for now this App class is somewhat
    rudimentary.

class App:
    """
    The main point of customization for the ARMI Framework.

    The App class is intended to be subclassed in order to customize the functionality
    and look-and-feel of the ARMI Framework for a specific use case. An App contains a
    plugin manager, which should be populated in ``__init__()`` with a collection of
    plugins that are deemed suitable for a given application, as well as other methods
    which provide further customization.

    The base App class is also a good place to expose some more convenient ways to get
    data out of the Plugin API; calling the ``pluggy`` hooks directly can sometimes be a
    pain, as the results returned by the individual plugins may need to be merged and/or
    checked for errors. Adding that logic here reduces boilerplate throughout the rest
    of the code.

    The program name of the app. This should be the actual name of the python entry
    point that loads the app, or the name of the module that contains the appropriate
    __main__ function. For example, if the app is expected to be invoked with ``python
    -m myapp``, ``name`` should be ``"myapp"``

        This mostly initializes the default plugin manager. Subclasses are free to adopt

        and start from scratch if they do not wish to use the default Framework plugins.
