The nucDirectory module contains general nuclide information through the
:py:mod:`~armi.nucDirectory.nuclideBases` module, and
information for :py:mod:`~armi.nucDirectory.nuclide` module.

#. :ref:`Element data <doc-elements>` - name, symbol, atomic number (Z).
#. :ref:`Generic nuclide data <doc-nuclide-bases>` - this includes  mass, atomic number, natural
   abundance and various names and labels that are used in ARMI for the nuclide. It also includes
   decay and transmutation modes.

.. _doc-elements:

Elements
========

:py:class:`Elements <armi.nucDirectory.elements.Element>` are simple objects containing minimal
information about... elements! This information is loaded from a data file within ARMI;
consequently modifying the data file will modify the list of elements in ARMI.

:py:class:`Elements <armi.nucDirectory.elements.Element>` are not used very often within armi,
and are mainly used as a building block of the nuclide objects discussed below. If you need to
grab an element for some reason there are three available dictionaries provided for rapid
access.::

    >>> from armi.nucDirectory import elements
    >>> uranium = elements.byZ[92]
    >>> uranium.name
    'uranium'
    >>> uranium.z
    92

Likewise, elements can be retrieved by their name or symbol.::

    >>> ironFromZ = elements.byZ[26]
    >>> ironFromName = elements.byName['iron']
    >>> ironFromSymbol = elements.bySymbol['FE']
    >>> ironFromZ == ironFromName == ironFromSymbol
    True

.. warning ::
    Note that :py:data:`~armi.nucDirectory.elements.byName` and
    :py:data:`~armi.nucDirectory.elements.bySymbol` are case specific;
    names are *lower case* and symbols are *UPPER CASE*.

The elements are truly the *same* :py:class:`~armi.nucDirectory.elements.Element` object.
The :py:mod:`~armi.nucDirectory`
makes efficient use of the memory being used by elements and will only ever contain ~118
:py:class:`Elements <armi.nucDirectory.elements.Element>`.::

    >>> id(ironFromZ) == id(ironFromName) == id(ironFromSymbol)
    True

.. _doc-nuclide-bases:

Nuclide Bases
=============

The :py:mod:`~armi.nucDirectory` allows ARMI to get information about various nuclides, like
U235 or FE56. Often times you need to look up cross section or densities for nuclides, or you
might need the atomic weight or the natural isotopic distribution. The
:py:mod:`~armi.nucDirectory` is here to help you with these common tasks.

The fundamental object of nuclide management in ARMI is the
:py:class:`~armi.nucDirectory.nuclideBases.INuclide` object. After construction, they contain
some basic information, such as Z, A, and atomic weight (if known). Similar to
:py:class:`Elements <armi.nucDirectory.elements.Element>`, the information is loaded from a
series of data files within ARMI. The data is originally from [NIST]_::

    >>> from armi.nucDirectory import nuclideBases
    >>> u235= nuclideBases.byName['U235']
    >>> u235.z
    92
    >>> u235.weight
    235.0439299
    >>> u235.a
    235

.. [NIST] http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/Compositions/stand_alone.pl

Upon loading the :py:mod:`armi.nucDirectory` package, the
:py:data:`nuclideBases.instances <armi.nucDirectory.nuclideBases.instances>`, will
be filled with nuclide base objects. Nuclide bases do not *do* much, but they contain a lot of
basic information about a nuclide, such as the atomic mass, atomic number (Z), the mass
number (A), the natural abundance, and all of the decay and transmutation modes (well, ARMI's
decay and transmutation modes).

Nuclide names, labels, and IDs
------------------------------
Nuclides have names, labels and IDs. 

:py:attr:`INuclide.name <armi.nucDirectory.nuclideBases.INuclide.name>`
    The nuclide name is what *should* be used within ARMI itself. This is a human readable name
    such as, ``U235`` or ``FE``. The names contain **only** capital letters and numbers, made up
    from the corresponding element symbol and mass number (A).

:py:attr:`INuclide.label <armi.nucDirectory.nuclideBases.INuclide.label>`
    The nuclide label is a unique 4 character name which identifies the nuclide from all others. 
    The label is fixed to 4 characters to conform with the CCCC standard files, which traditionally
    only allow for a maximum of 6 character labels in legacy nuclear codes. Of the 6 allowable
    characters, 4 are reserved for the unique identifier of the nuclide and 2 characters are reserved
    for cross section labels (i.e., AA, AB, ZA, etc.). The cross section labels are based on the
    cross section group manager implementation within the framework. These labels are not necessarily 
    human readable/interpretable, but are generally the nuclide symbol followed by the last two digits 
    of the mass number (A), so the nuclide for U235 has the label ``U235``, but PU239 has the label 
    ``PU39``.

For reference, there is a complete list of the nuclides along with the names, labels and IDs
:py:mod:`here <armi.nucDirectory.nuclideBases>`.

Indices - rapid access
----------------------

There are three main ways to retrieve a nuclide, which are provided for convenience depending on
what information you have, or "know," about a nuclide. For example, if you know a nuclide name, use
the :py:data:`~armi.nucDirectory.nuclideBases.byName` dictionary. There are also dictionaries
available for retrieving by the label, :py:data:`~armi.nucDirectory.nuclideBases.byLabel`, and by
other software-specific IDs (i.e., MCNP, Serpent, MC2-2, and MC2-3). The software-specific labels
are incorporated into the framework to support plugin developments and may be extended as needed
by end-users as needs arise.

    >>> from armi.nucDirectory import nuclideBases
    >>> pu239 = nuclideBases.byName['PU239']
    >>> pu239.z
    94

Just like with elements, the item retrieved from the various dictionaries are the same object.

    >>> tinFromName = nuclideBases.byName['SN112']
    >>> tinFromLabel = nuclideBases.byLabel['SN112']
    >>> tinFromMcc2Id = nuclideBases.byName['SN1125']
    >>> tinFromMcc3Id = nuclideBases.byLabel['SN1127']
    >>> tinFromName == tinFromLabel == tinFromMcc2Id == tinFromMcc3Id
    True
    >>> id(tinFromName) == id(tinFromLabel) == id(tinFromMcc2Id) == id(tinFromMcc3Id)
    True

.. warning::
    If you find yourself using a name or label within ARMI itself, it is probably not as efficient
    as it could be. Many older, but still existing, data structures within ARMI use nuclide names
    and labels for indexing certain information about the nuclide, such as number density.
    However, often times they will also need other information, such as the mass. Consequently,
    the index which contains the name or label is not fulfilling its intended purpose; in order to
    perform the operation, ``weight * numberDensity``, you'll still need the nuclide object!
