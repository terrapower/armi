Handle awareness of Thermal Scattering Laws.

Scattering characteristics of thermal neutrons are often significantly different
between a free atom and one bound in a particular molecule. Nuclear data libraries
often have special tables to account for the bound states.
These data are commonly represented as S(alpha, beta) tables.

Here we provide objects representing the thermal scattering law (TSL) information.
We expect them to be most useful as class attributes on :py:class:`~armi.materials.material.Material` subclasses
to inform physics solvers that support thermal scattering of the TSLs. See
:py:class:`~armi.materials.graphite.Graphite` for an example.

We do not provide special versions of various NuclideBases like C12 because of
potential errors in choosing one over the other

The information contained in here is based on Parsons, LA-UR-18-25096,
https://mcnp.lanl.gov/pdf_files/la-ur-18-25096.pdf

Scattering law data are currently available for a variety of classifications:

* Element in Compound (H in H2O, Be in BeO)
* Element in structure (C in Graphite, Be in metal)

    * Can be separated as crystalline, 30% porous, 10% porous, etc.

* Element in spin isomer (para H, ortho H, para D, ortho D, etc.)
* Compound in phase (solid CH4, liquid CH4, SiO2-alpha, SiO2-beta).
* Just compound (benzene)
* Just isotope (Fe56, Al27)

The labels for these vary across evaluations (e.g. ENDF/B-VII, ENDF/B-VIII, etc.). We provide
ENDF/B-III.0 and ACE labels. Other physics kernels will have to derive their own labels
as appropriate in client code.

Like NuclideBase and Element, we want to have only one ThermalScattering instance
for each TSL, so we use a module-level directory called ``byNbAndCompound``. This improves
efficiency and allows better cross-referencing when thousands of material instances
would otherwise have identical instances of these.

Thus, in practice, users should rarely instantiate these on their own.
