Handle awareness of Thermal Scattering labels for ENDF/B-VIII and ACE.

The information below is based on Parsons, LA-UR-18-25096, https://mcnp.lanl.gov/pdf_files/la-ur-18-25096.pdf

Scattering law labels are currently available for a variety of classifications:

* Element in Compound (H in H2O, Be in BeO)
* Element in structure (C in Graphite, Be in metal)

    * Can be separated as crystalline, 30% porous, 10% porous, etc.

* Element in spin isomer (para H, ortho H, para D, ortho D, etc.)
* Compound in phase (solid CH4, liquid CH4, SiO2-alpha, SiO2-beta).
* Just compound (benzene)
* Just isotope (Fe56, Al27)

The labels for these vary across evaluations (e.g. ENDF/B-VII, ENDF/B-VIII, etc.). We provide ENDF/B-III.0 and ACE
labels. Other physics kernels will have to derive their own labels as appropriate in client code.
