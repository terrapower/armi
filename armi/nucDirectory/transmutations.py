.. inheritance-diagram::
    Transmutation DecayMode

The mappings between active nuclides during transmutation and decay are described in a
``burn-chain.yaml`` file pointed to by the ``burnChainFileName``
setting. This file contains one entry per nuclide that can transmute or decay that
look similar to the example below::

    U238:
    - nuSF: 2.0000
    - transmutation:
        branch: 1.0
        products:
        - NP237
        type: n2n
    - transmutation:
        branch: 1.0
        products:
        - LFP38
        type: fission
    - transmutation:
        branch: 1.0
        products:
        - NP239
        - PU239
        type: nGamma
    - decay:
        branch: 5.45000e-07
        halfLifeInSeconds: 1.4099935680e+17
        products:
        - LFP38
        type: sf

This example defines 3 transmutations (an ``(n,2n)`` reaction, an ``(n,fission)`` reaction, an
``(n,gamma``)`` reaction), and a spontaneous fission decay reaction with a very low branching
ratio. Valid reaction ``type`` values are listed in :py:class:`~armi.nucDirectory.transmutations.Transmutation`
and :py:class:`~armi.nucDirectory.transmutations.DecayMode`.

The ``branch`` entry determines the fraction of the products of a given reaction that will end up
in a particular product. The branches must never sum up to anything other than 1.0.

The ``products`` entry is a list, but only one entry will be the actual product. The list defines
a preference order. For example, if ``NP239`` is being tracked as an active nuclide in the problem
it will be the product of the ``nGamma`` reaction above. Otherwise, ``U238`` will transmute directly
to the alternate product, ``PU239``.

.. warning:: If you track very short-lived decays explicitly then the burn matrix becomes very
             ill-conditioned and numerical solver issues can result. Specialized matrix
             exponential solvers (e.g. CRAM [1]) are required to get adequate solutions in these cases [2].

The example above also defines a ``nuSF`` item, which is how many neutrons are emitted per spontaneous
fission. This is used for intrinsic source term calculations.

class Transmutable:

    Transmutable base class.

    Attributes
    ----------
    parent : NuclideBase
        The parent nuclide in this reaction.
    type : str
        The type name of reaction (e.g. ``n2n``, ``fission``, etc.)
    productNuclides : list
        The names of potential product nuclides of this reaction, in order of preference.
        Multiple options exist to allow the library to specify a transmutation
        to one nuclide if the user is modeling that nuclide, and other ones
        as fallbacks in case the user is not tracking the preferred product.
        Only one of these products will be created.
    productParticle : str
        The outgoing particle of this reaction. Could be HE4 for n,alpha, etc.
        Default is None.
    branch : float
        The fraction of the time that this transmutation occurs. Should be between
        0 and 1. Less than 1 when a decay or reaction can branch between multiple productNuclides.
        Do not make this >1 to get more than one product because it scales the reaction cross section
        which will double-deplete the parent.
