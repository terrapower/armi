Visualization implementation for VTK files.

Limitations
-----------
This version of the VTK file writer comes with a number of limitations and/or aspects
that can be improved upon. For instance
 - Only the Block and Assembly meshes and related parameters are exported to the VTK
   file. Adding Core data is totally doable, and will be the product of future work.
   With more considerable effort, arbitrary components may be visualizable!
 - No efforts are made to de-duplicate the vertices in the mesh, so there are more
   vertices than needed. Some fancy canned algorithms probably exist to do this, and it
   wouldn't be too difficult to do here either. Also future work, but probably not super
   important unless dealing with really big meshes.
