The Visualization package contains functionality and entry points for producing files
amenable to visualization of ARMI run results.

This could theoretically support all sorts of visualization file formats, but for now,
only VTK files are supported. VTK was selected because it has wide support from vis
tools, while being a simple-enough format that quality pure-Python libraries exist to
produce them. Other formats (e.g., SILO) tend to require more system-dependent binary
dependencies, so optional support for them may be added later.
