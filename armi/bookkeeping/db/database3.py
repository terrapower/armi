ARMI Database implementation, version 3.

This Implementation of the database is a significant departure from the previous. One of
the foundational concepts in this version is that a reactor model should be fully
recoverable from the database itself; all the way down to the component level. As a
result, the structure of the underlying data is bound to the hierarchical Composite
Reactor Model, rather than an ad hoc collection of Block parameter fields and other
parameters. Furthermore, this format is intended to be more dynamic, permitting as-yet
undeveloped levels and classes in the Composite Reactor Model to be supported as they
are added. More high-level discussion is contained in :doc:`/user/outputs/database`.

The most important contents of this module are the :py:class:`DatabaseInterface`, the
:py:class:`Database3` class, the :py:class:`Layout` class, and the special data
packing/unpacking functions. The ``Database3`` class contains most of the functionality
for interacting with the underlying data. This includes things like dumping a Reactor
state to the database and loading it back again, as well as extracting historical data
for a given object or collection of object from the database file. When interacting with
the database file, the ``Layout`` class is used to help map the hierarchical Composite
Reactor Model to the flat representation in the database.

Refer to :py:mod:`armi.bookkeeping.db` for notes about versioning.

Minor revision changelog
------------------------
 - 3.1: Improve the handling of reading/writing grids.

 - 3.2: Change the strategy for storing large attributes from using an Object Reference
   to an external dataset to using a special string starting with an "@" symbol (e.g.,
   "@/c00n00/attrs/5_linkedDims"). This was done to support copying time node datasets
   from one file to another without invalidating the references. Support is maintained
   for reading previous versions, and for performing a ``mergeHistory()`` and converting
   to the new reference strategy, but the old version cannot be written.

 - 3.3: Compress the way locations are stored in the database and allow MultiIndex
   locations to be read and written.

 - 3.4: Modified the way that locations are stored in the database to include complete
   indices for indices that can be composed from multiple grids. This was done since the
   space is already being used to be able to store them, and because having complete
   indices allows for more efficient means of extracting information based on location
   without having to compose the full model.

        Discard all data except for specific time steps, retaining old data in a separate file.

        This is useful when performing more exotic analyses, where each "time step" may
        not represent a specific point in time, but something more nuanced. For example,
        equilibrium cases store a new "cycle" for each iteration as it attempts to
        converge the equilibrium cycle. At the end of the run, the last "cycle" is the
        converged equilibrium cycle, whereas the previous cycles constitute the path to
        convergence, which we typically wish to discard before further analysis.

class Layout:
    """
    The Layout class describes the hierarchical layout of the composite structure in a flat representation.

    A Layout is built up by starting at the root of a composite tree and recursively
    appending each node in the tree to the list of data. So for a typical Reactor model,
    the data will be ordered something like [r, c, a1, a1b1, a1b1c1, a1b1c2, a1b2,
    a1b2c1, ..., a2, ...]

    The layout is also responsible for storing Component attributes, like location,
    material, and temperatures (from blueprints), which aren't stored as Parameters.
    Temperatures, specifically, are rather complicated beasts in ARMI, and more
    fundamental changes to how we deal with them may allow us to remove them from
    Layout.

    Notes
    -----
    As this format is liable to be consumed by other code, it is important to specify
    its structure so that code attempting to read/write Layouts can make safe
    assumptions. Below is a list of things to be aware of. More will be added as issues
    arise or things become more precise:

     * Elements in Layout are stored in depth-first order. This permits use of
       algorithms such as Pre-Order Tree Traversal for efficient traversal of regions of
       the model.

     * ``indexInData`` increases monotonically within each object ``type``. This means
       that, for instance, the data for all ``HexBlock`` children of a given parent
       are stored contiguously within the ``HexBlock`` group, and will not be
       interleaved with data from the ``HexBlock`` children of any of the parent's
       siblings.

     * Aside from the hierarchy itself, there is no guarantee what order objects are
       stored in the layout.  "`The` ``Core``" is not necessarily the first child of the
       ``Reactor``, and is not guaranteed to use the zeroth grid.

        Return a list containing the serial number of the parent corresponding to each
        object at the given depth.

        Depth in this case means how many layers to reach up to find the desired
        ancestor. A depth of 1 will yield the direct parent of each element, depth of 2
        would yield the elemen's parent's parent, and so on.

        The zero-th element will always be None, as the first object is the root element
        and so has no parent. Subsequent depths will result in more Nones.

        This function is useful for forming a lightweight sense of how the database
        contents stitch together, without having to go to the trouble of fully unpacking
        the Reactor model.

        consuming two lists, of which we would need to keep passing down with an

) -> Tuple[Optional[numpy.ndarray], Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Reduce data that wouldn't otherwise play nicely with HDF5/numpy arrays to a format
    that will.

    This is the main entry point for conforming "strange" data into something that will
    both fit into a numpy array/HDF5 dataset, and be recoverable to its original-ish
    state when reading it back in. This is accomplished by detecting a handful of known
    offenders and using various HDF5 attributes to store necessary auxiliary data. It is
    important to keep in mind that the data that is passed in has already been converted
    to a numpy array, so the top dimension is always representing the collection of
    composites that are storing the parameters. For instance, if we are dealing with a
    Block parameter, the first index in the numpy array of data is the block index; so
    if each block has a parameter that is a dictionary, ``data`` would be a ndarray,
    where each element is a dictionary. This routine supports a number of different
    "strange" things:
    * Dict[str, float]: These are stored by finding the set of all keys for all
      instances, and storing those keys as a list in an attribute. The data themselves
      are stored as arrays indexed by object, then key index. Dictionaries lacking data
      for a key store a nan in it's place. This will work well in instances where most
      objects have data for most keys.
    * Jagged arrays: These are stored by concatenating all of the data into a single,
      one-dimensional array, and storing attributes to describe the shapes of each
      object's data, and an offset into the beginning of each object's data.
    * Arrays with ``None`` in them: These are stored by replacing each instance of
      ``None`` with a magical value that shouldn't be encountered in realistic
      scenarios.


    Parameters
    ----------
    data
        An ndarray storing the data that we want to stuff into the database. These are
        usually dtype=Object, which is how we usually end up here in the first place.

    paramName
        The parameter name that we are trying to store data for. This is mostly used for
        diagnostics.

    paramName

    This only supports situations where the data is a straight-up ``None``, or a valid,
