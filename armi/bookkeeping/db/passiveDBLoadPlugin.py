"""
Provides the ability to ignore parameters sections of blueprint files.

This plugin can allow you to more easily open a database, because you can ignore sections of the
blueprint files, and ignore any parameters as you want.

This was designed to allow loading an ARMI database without the application that created it.

    This plugin allows you two define two things:

    1. Sections of blueprint files to ignore entirely.
    2. A collection of unknown parameters that will be loaded without units or underlying metadata.

    To use this plugin, you need to set two class variables before instantiating the ARMI App:

    1. Set ``SKIP_BP_SECTIONS`` to a list of BP section names (strings).
    2. Set ``UNKNOWN_PARAMS`` to a mapping from param class to name: ``{Core: ["a", "b", "c"]}``

    Notes
    -----
    Obviously, if you are loading huge numbers of unknown parameters and ignoring whole sections of
    blueprints, you are losing information. There is no way to use this plugin and still claim full
    fidelity of your understanding of the reactor. ARMI does not support any such claims.
