    """
    Return an appropriate object for interacting with a database file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dbName: str
        Path to db file, e.g. `baseCase.h5`
    permission: str
        String defining permission, `r` for read only. See armi.bookeeping.db.permissions
    version: str, optional
        Version of database you want to read or write. In many cases ARMI will
        auto-detect. For advanced users.

    Notes
    -----
    This is not a proper factory, as the different database versions do not present a
    common interface. However, this is useful code, since it at least creates an object
    based on some knowledge of how to probe around. This allows client code to just
    interrogate the type of the returned object to figure out to do based on whatever it
    needs.
