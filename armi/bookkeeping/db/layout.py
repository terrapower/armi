class Layout:
    """
    The Layout class describes the hierarchical layout of the Composite Reactor model
    in a flat representation for
    :py:class:`Database3 <armi.bookkeeping.db.database3.Database3>`.

    A Layout is built by starting at the root of a composite tree and recursively
    appending each node in the tree to a list of data. So the data will be ordered by
    depth-first search: [r, c, a1, a1b1, a1b1c1, a1b1c2, a1b2, a1b2c1, ..., a2, ...].

    The layout is also responsible for storing Component attributes, like location,
    material, and temperatures, which aren't stored as Parameters. Temperatures,
    specifically, are rather complicated in ARMI.

    Notes
    -----
     * Elements in Layout are stored in depth-first order. This permits use of
       algorithms such as Pre-Order Tree Traversal for efficient traversal of regions
       of the model.

     * ``indexInData`` increases monotonically within each object ``type``. For
       example, the data for all ``HexBlock`` children of a given parent are stored
       contiguously within the ``HexBlock`` group, and will not be interleaved with
       data from the ``HexBlock`` children of any of the parent's siblings.

     * Aside from the hierarchy, there is no guarantee what order objects are stored
       in the layout.  The ``Core`` is not necessarily the first child of the
       ``Reactor``, and is not guaranteed to use the zeroth grid.

        Depth in this case means how many layers to reach up to find the desired
        ancestor. A depth of 1 will yield the direct parent of each element, depth of 2
        would yield the elemen's parent's parent, and so on.

        The zero-th element will always be None, as the first object is the root element
        and so has no parent. Subsequent depths will result in more Nones.

        This function is useful for forming a lightweight sense of how the database
        contents stitch together, without having to go to the trouble of fully unpacking
        the Reactor model.

        Parameters
        ----------
        serialNum : List of int
            List of serial numbers for each object/element, as laid out in Layout
        numChildren : List of int
            List of numbers of children for each object/element, as laid out in Layout

        Note
        ----
        This is not using a recursive approach for a couple of reasons. First, the
        iterative form isn't so bad; we just need two stacks. Second, the interface of
        the recursive function would be pretty unwieldy. We are progressively
        consuming two lists, of which we would need to keep passing down with an
        index/cursor, or progressively slice them as we go, which would be pretty
        inefficient.

    Replace instances of ``None`` with nonsense values that can be detected/recovered

    Parameters
    ----------
    data
        The numpy array containing ``None`` values that need to be replaced.

    paramName
        The name of the parameter who's data we are treating. Only used for diagnostics.

    nones
        An array containing the index locations on the ``None`` elements. It is a little
        strange to pass these, in but we find these indices to determine whether we need
        to call this function in the first place, so might as well pass it in, so that

    -----
    This only supports situations where the data is a straight-up ``None``, or a valid,

    numerical values)). This does not support, for instance, a numpy ndarray with some
    Nones in it.
