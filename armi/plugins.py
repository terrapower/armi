Plugins allow various built-in or external functionality to be brought into the ARMI ecosystem.

This module defines the hooks that may be defined within plugins. Plugins are ultimately
incorporated into a :py:class:`armi.pluginManager.ArmiPluginManager`, which live inside
of a :py:class:`armi.apps.App` object.

The ``ArmiPluginManager`` is derived from the ``PluginManager`` class provided by the
``pluggy`` package, which provides a registry of known plugins. Rather than create one
directly, we use the :py:func:`armi.plugins.getNewPluginManager()` function, which
handles some of the setup for us.

From a high-altitude perspective, the plugins provide numerous "hooks", which allow for
ARMI to be extended in various ways. Some of these extensions are subtle and play a part
in how certain ARMI components are initialized or defined. As such, it is necessary to
register most plugins before some parts of ARMI are imported or exercised in a
meaningful way. These requirements are in flux, and will ultimately constitute part of
the specification of the ARMI plugin architecture. For now, to be safe, plugins should
be registered as soon as possible.

After forming the ``PluginManager``, the plugin hooks can be accessed through the
``hook`` attribute. E.g.::

    >>> armi.getPluginManagerOrFail().hook.exposeInterfaces(cs=cs)

Don't forget to use the keyword argument form for all arguments to hooks; ``pluggy``
requires them to enforce hook specifications.

The :py:class:`armi.apps.App` class serves as the primary storage location of the
PluginManager, and also provides some methods to get data out of the plugins more
ergonomically than through the hooks themselves.

Some things you may want to bring in via a plugin includes:

- :py:mod:`armi.settings` and their validators
- :py:mod:`armi.reactor.components` for custom geometry
- :py:mod:`armi.reactor.flags` for custom reactor components
- :py:mod:`armi.interfaces` to define new calculation sequences and interactions with new codes
- :py:mod:`armi.reactor.parameters` to represent new physical state on the reactor
- :py:mod:`armi.materials` for custom materials
- Elements of the :py:mod:`armi.gui`
- :py:mod:`armi.operators` for adding new operations on reactor models
- :py:mod:`armi.cli` for adding new operations on input files

Warning
-------
The plugin system was developed to support improved collaboration.  It is new and should
be considered under development. The API is subject to change as the version of the ARMI
framework approaches 1.0.

Notes
-----
Due to the nature of some of these components, there are a couple of restrictions on
the order in which things can be imported (lest we endeavor to redesign them
considerably). Examples:

  - Parameters: All parameter definitions must be present before any ``ArmiObject``
    objects are instantiated. This is mostly by choice, but also makes the most sense,
    because the ``ParameterCollection`` s are instance attributes of an ``ArmiObject``,
    which in turn use ``Parameter`` objects as *class* attributes. We should know
    what class attributes we have before making instances.

  - Blueprints: Since blueprints should be extendable with new sections, we must also
    be able to provide new *class* attributes to extend their behavior. This is
    because blueprints use the yamlize package, which uses class attributes to define
    much of the class's behavior through metaclassing. Therefore, we need to be able
    to import all plugins *before* importing blueprints.

Plugins are currently stateless. They do not have ``__init__()`` methods, and when they are
registered with the PluginMagager, the PluginManager gets the Plugin's class object
rather than an instance of that class. Also notice that all of the hooks are
``@staticmethod``\ s. As a result, they can be called directly off of the class object,
and only have access to the state passed into them to perform their function. This is a
deliberate design choice to keep the plugin system simple and to preclude a large class
of potential bugs. At some point it may make sense to revisit this.

**Other customization points**

While the Plugin API is the main place for ARMI framework customization, there are
several other areas where ARMI may be extended or customized. These typically pre-dated
the Plugin-based architecture, and as the need arise may be migrated to here.

    - Component types: Component types are registered dynamically through some metaclass
      magic, found in :py:class:`armi.reactor.components.component.ComponentType` and
      :py:class:`armi.reactor.composites.CompositeModelType`. Simply defining a new
      Component subclass should register it with the appropriate ARMI systems. While this
      is convenient, it does lead to potential issues, as the behavior of ARMI becomes
      sensitive to module import order and the like; the containing module needs to be
      imported before the registration occurs, which can be surprising.

    - Interface input files: Interfaces used to be discovered dynamically, rather than
      explicitly as they are now in the :py:meth:`armi.plugins.ArmiPlugin.exposeInterfaces`
      plugin hook. Essentially they functioned as ersatz plugins. One of the ways that they
      would customize ARMI behavior is through the
      :py:meth:`armi.physics.interface.Interface.specifyInputs` static method, which is
      still used to determine inter-Case dependencies and support cloning and hashing Case
      inputs. Going forward, this approach will likely be deprecated in favor of a plugin
      hook.

    - Fuel handler logic: The
      :py:class:`armi.physics.fuelCycle.fuelHandlers.FuelHandlerInterface` supports
      customization through the dynamic loading of fuel handler logic modules, based on
      user settings. This also predated the plugin infrastructure, and may one day be
      replaced with plugin-based fuel handler logic.

        Most of the sections that a plugin would want to add may be better served as

        blueprints mainly because the schema is more flexible, allowing namespaces and
        hierarchical collections of settings. Perhaps in the near future it would make

        Return a mapping from old parameter names to new parameter names.

        Occasionally, it may become necessary to alter the name of an existing

        database files that use the previous name. This hook allows a plugin to define
        mappings from the old name to the new name, allowing the old database to be read
        in and translated to the new parameter name.

        The following rules are followed when applying these renames:

        * When state is loaded from a database, if the parameter name in the database
          file is found in the rename dictionary, it will be mapped to that renamed
          parameter.
        * If the renamed parameter is found in the renames, then it will be mapped again
          to new parameter name. This process is repeated until there are no more
          renames left. This allows for parameters to be renamed multiple times, and for
          a database from several generations prior to still be readable, so long as the
          history of renames is intact.
        * If at the end of the above process, the parameter name is not a defined
          parameter for the appropriate ``ArmiObject`` type, an exception is raised.
        * If any of the ``renames`` keys match any currently-defined parameters, an
          exception is raised.
        * If any of the ``renames`` collide with another plugin's ``renames``, an
          exception is raised.

            the new parameter name.

        Example
        -------
        The following would allow databases with values for either ``superOldParam`` or
        ``oldParam`` to be read into ``currentParam``::

            return {"superOldParam": "oldParam",
