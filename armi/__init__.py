Welcome to the Advanced Reactor Modeling Interface (ARMI).

This module initializes the ARMI platform. The bootstrap process is broken into several phases:

* Import fundamental dependencies in Python library and some third-party libs
* Investigate environment: Check Python version, check code version, check MPI situation,
  check for TTY/GUI/interactivity,
* Set up temp dirs
* Set up printout table formats (in preparation of logging info)
* Initialize all possible nuclide objects in the nuclide directory
* Discover and register available built-in :py:mod:`plugins <armi.plugins>`
  (custom ones registered after input available)
* Discover and define all potential configuration settings from available plugins
* Read input files
* Update :py:mod:`nuclide directory <armi.nucDirectory>` with depletion info based on config
* Discover and define all state :py:mod:`Parameters <armi.reactor.parameters>` on data model
  (possibly dependent on config)
* Discover :py:mod:`Entry points <armi.cli>` from plugins
* Choose entry point based on user command

If using the ``run`` entry point, additional work is done:

* Build :py:mod:`reactor model <armi.reactor>` based on input
* Build :py:mod:`operator object <armi.operators>` with specific calculation loop
* Build ordered interface stack based on configuration settings
* Begin looping over interface stack, operating upon data model according to operator design
* Loop until complete
* Wrap up
* Quit

    ----------
    app :
        An :py:class:`armi.apps.App` instance with which the framework is to be
        configured. If it is not provided, then the default ARMI App will be used.
    permissive :
        Whether or not an error should be produced if ``configure`` is called more than
        once. This should only be set to ``True`` under testing or demonstration
        purposes, where the contents of otherwise independent scripts need to be run

    Important
    ---------
    Since this affects the behavior of several modules at their import time, it is
    generally not safe to re-configure the ARMI framework once it has been configured.
    Therefore this will raise an ``RuntimeError`` if such a re-configuration is
    attempted, unless ``permissive`` is set to ``True``.

    Notes
    -----
    We are planning on encapsulating much of the global ARMI state that gets configured
    with an App into the App object itself (with some other things going into the Case
    object). This will provide a number of benefits, the main one being that it will
    become trivial to re-configure the framework, which is currently not possible.
