    Attributes
    ----------
    inputFile : str
        Name of main input file. Often passed to stdin of external code.
    outputFile : str
        Name of main output file. Often the stdout of external code.
    extraInputFiles : list of tuples
        (sourceName, destName) pairs of file names that will be brought from the
        working dir into the runDir. Allows renames while in transit.
    extraOutputFiles : list of tuples
        (sourceName, destName) pairs of file names that will be extracted from the
        runDir to the working dir
    executablePath : str
        Path to external executable to run (if external code is used)
    runDir : str
        Path on running system where the run will take place. This is often used
        to ensure external codes that use hard-drive disk space run on a local disk
        rather than a shared network drive
    workingDir : str
        Path on system where results will be placed after the run. This is often
        a shared network location. Auto-applied during execution by default.
    label : str
        A name for the run that may be used as a prefix for input/output files generated.
    interface : str
        A name for the interface calling the Executer that may be used to organize the
        input/output files generated within sub-folders under the working directory.
    savePhysicsFiles : bool
        Dump the physics kernel I/O files from the execution to a dedicated directory that
        will not be overwritten so they will be available after the run.
    copyOutput : bool
        Copy the output from running the executable back to the working directory.
    applyResultsToReactor : bool
        Update the in-memory reactor model with results upon completion. Set to False
        when information from a run is needed for auxiliary purposes rather than progressing
        the reactor model.
