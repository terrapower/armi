def getOptimalAssemblyOrientation(a, aPrev):
    """
    Get optimal assembly orientation/rotation to minimize peak burnup.

    Notes
    -----
    Works by placing the highest-BU pin in the location (of 6 possible locations) with lowest
    expected pin power. We evaluated "expected pin power" based on the power distribution in
    aPrev, which is the previous assembly located here. If aPrev has no pin detail, then we must use its
    corner fast fluxes to make an estimate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : Assembly object
        The assembly that is being rotated.

    aPrev : Assembly object
        The assembly that previously occupied this location (before the last shuffle).

        If the assembly "a" was not shuffled, then "aPrev" = "a".

        If "aPrev" has pin detail, then we will determine the orientation of "a" based on
        the pin powers of "aPrev" when it was located here.

        If "aPrev" does NOT have pin detail, then we will determine the orientation of "a" based on
        the corner fast fluxes in "aPrev" when it was located here.

    Returns
    -------
    rot : int
        An integer from 0 to 5 representing the "orientation" of the assembly.
        This orientation is relative to the current assembly orientation.
        rot = 0 corresponds to no rotation.
        rot represents the number of pi/3 counterclockwise rotations for the default orientation.

    r"""
    Build a ring schedule for shuffling.

    Notes
    -----
    General enough to do convergent, divergent, or any combo, plus jumprings.

    The center of the core is ring 1, based on the DIF3D numbering scheme.

    Jump ring behavior can be generalized by first building a base ring list
    where assemblies get charged to H and discharge from A::

        [A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H]

    If a jump should be placed where it jumps from ring G to C, reversed back to F, and then discharges from A,
    we simply reverse the sublist [C,D,E,F], leaving us with::

        [A,B,F,E,D,C,G,H]

    A less-complex, more standard convergent-divergent scheme is a subcase of this, where the
    sublist [A,B,C,D,E] or so is reversed, leaving::

        [E,D,C,B,A,F,G,H]

    So the task of this function is simply to determine what subsection, if any, to reverse of
    the baselist.

    Parameters
    ----------
    maxRingInCore : int
        The number of rings in the hex assembly reactor.

    chargeRing : int, optional
        The peripheral ring into which an assembly enters the core. Default is outermost ring.

    dischargeRing : int, optional
        The last ring an assembly sits in before discharging. Default is jumpRing-1

    jumpRingFrom : int
        The last ring an assembly sits in before jumping to the center

    jumpRingTo : int, optional
        The inner ring into which a jumping assembly jumps. Default is 1.

    coarseFactor : float, optional
        A number between 0 and 1 where 0 hits all rings and 1 only hits the outer, rJ, center, and rD rings.
        This allows coarse shuffling, with large jumps. Default: 0

    Returns
    -------
