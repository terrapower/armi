Algorithms used to rotate hex assemblies in a reactor core.

-----
These algorithms are defined in assemblyRotationAlgorithms.py, but they are used in:
``FuelHandler.outage()``.

    Rotate all pin-detail assemblies that were just shuffled by 60 degrees

    Parameters
    ----------
    fh : FuelHandler object
        A fully initialized FuelHandler object.

    Notes
    -----
    Also, optionally rotate stationary (non-shuffled) assemblies if the setting is set.
    Obviously, only pin-detail assemblies can be rotated, because homogenized assemblies are isotropic.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> simpleAssemblyRotation(fh)
