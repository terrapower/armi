"""
This module handles fuel management operations such as shuffling, rotation, and
fuel processing (in fluid systems).

The :py:class:`FuelHandlerInterface` instantiates a ``FuelHandler``, which is typically a user-defined
subclass the :py:class:`FuelHandler` object in custom shuffle-logic input files.
Users point to the code modules with their custom fuel handlers using the
``shuffleLogic`` and ``fuelHandlerName`` settings, as described in :doc:`/user/inputs/fuel_management`.
These subclasses override ``chooseSwaps`` that determine
the particular shuffling of a case.

This module also handles repeat shuffles when doing a restart.

        Get optimal assembly orientation/rotation to minimize peak burnup.

        Notes
        -----
        Works by placing the highest-BU pin in the location (of 6 possible locations) with lowest
        expected pin power. We evaluated "expected pin power" based on the power distribution in
        aPrev, which is the previous assembly located here. If aPrev has no pin detail, then we must use its
        corner fast fluxes to make an estimate.

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : Assembly object
            The assembly that is being rotated.

        aPrev : Assembly object
            The assembly that previously occupied this location (before the last shuffle).

            If the assembly "a" was not shuffled, then "aPrev" = "a".

            If "aPrev" has pin detail, then we will determine the orientation of "a" based on
            the pin powers of "aPrev" when it was located here.

            If "aPrev" does NOT have pin detail, then we will determine the orientation of "a" based on
            the corner fast fluxes in "aPrev" when it was located here.

        Returns
        -------
        rot : int
            An integer from 0 to 5 representing the "orientation" of the assembly.
            This orientation is relative to the current assembly orientation.
            rot = 0 corresponds to no rotation.
            rot represents the number of pi/3 counterclockwise rotations for the default orientation.

        This was used historically to keep a long-lived fuel handler in sync

        many historical fuel management inputs still expect it to be called

        a ``_prepSearch`` private method.

        It now should not be used and will trigger a DeprecationWarning
        in the constructor. It's still here because old user-input code
        calls the parent's prepSearch, which is this.

        Search reactor for assemblies with various criterion. Primarily for shuffling.

        Parameters
        ----------
        targetRing : int, optional
            The ring in which to search

        width : tuple of integers
            A (size, side) tuple where size is the number of rings on either side to also check.
            side=1: only look in higher, -1: only look lower, 0: both sides

        param : string, optional
            A block (if blockLevelMax) or assem level param name such as 'power' or 'percentBu'
            (requires compareTo).

        compareTo : float or Assembly instance
            an assembly to be compared to. Alternatively, a floating point number to compare to.
            Even more alternatively,  an (assembly,mult) or (float,mult) tuple where mult is a
            multiplier. For example, if you wanted an assembly that had a bu close to half of
            assembly bob, you'd give param='percentBu', compareTo=(bob,0.5) If you want one with a
            bu close to 0.3, you'd do param='percentBu',compareTo=0.3. Yes, if you give a (float,
            multiplier) tuple, the code will make fun of you for not doing your own math, but will
            still operate as expected.

        forceSide : bool, optional
            requires the found assembly to have either 1: higher, -1: lower, None: any param than
             compareTo

        exclusions : list, optional
            List of assemblies that will be excluded from the search

        minParam : float or list, optional
            a parameter to compare to minVal for setting lower bounds. If list, must correspond to
            parameters in minVal in order.

        maxParam : float or list, optional
            a parameter to compare to maxVal for setting upper bounds of acceptable assemblies.
            If list,
            must correspond to parameters in maxVal in order.

        minVal : float or list, optional
            a value or a (parameter, multiplier) tuple for setting lower bounds

            For instance, if minParam = 'timeToLimit' and minVal=10, only assemblies with
            timeToLimit higher than 10 will be returned.  (Of course, there is also maxParam and
            maxVal)

        maxVal : float or list, optional
            a value or a (parameter, multiplier) tuple for setting upper bounds

        mandatoryLocations : list, optional
            a list of string-representations of locations in the core for limiting the search to
            several places

            Any locations also included in `excludedLocations` will be excluded.

        excludedLocations : list, optional
            a list of string-representations of locations in the core that will be excluded from
            the search

        zoneList : list, optional
            name of a zone defined in settings.py that will be picked from. Under development

        findMany : bool, optional
            If True, will return a list of assembies that match. Don't give a param.

        typeSpec : Flags or list of Flags, optional
            only assemblies with this type list will be returned. If none, only fuel will be found.

        coords : tuple, optional
            x,y tuple in cm. the fuel handler will try to find an assembly with a center closest to
            that point

        exactType : bool, optional
            require type to be exactly equal to what's in the type list. So
            Flags.IGNITER | Flags.FUEL is not Flags.INNER | Flags.IGNITER | Flags.FUEL

        acceptFirstCandidateRing : bool, optional
            takes the first assembly found in the earliest ring (without searching all rings for a
            maxBu, for example) So if the candidate rings are 1-10 and we're looking for igniter
            fuel with a maxBurnup, we don't get the max burnup in all those rings, but rather the
            igniter with the max burnup in the ring closest to 1. If there are no igniters until
            ring 4, you will get an igniter in ring 4.

        blockLevelMax : bool, optional
            If true, the param to search for will be built as the maximum block-level param of this
            name instead of the assembly param. This avoids the need to assign assembly level params
            sometimes.
            default: false.

        findFromSfp : bool, optional
            if true, will look in the spent-fuel pool instead of in the core.

        maxNumAssems : int, optional
            The maximum number of assemblies to return. Only relevant if findMany==True

        circularRingFlag : bool, optional
            A flag to toggle on using rings that are based on distance from the center of the
            reactor

        Notes
        -----
        The call signature on this method may have gotten slightly out of hand as
        valuable capabilities were added in fuel management studies. For additional expansion,
        it may be worth reconsidering the design of these query operations ;).

        Build a ring schedule for shuffling.

        Notes
        -----
        General enough to do convergent, divergent, or any combo, plus jumprings.

        The center of the core is ring 1, based on the DIF3D numbering scheme.

        Jump ring behavior can be generalized by first building a base ring list
        where assemblies get charged to H and discharge from A::

            [A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H]


        If a jump should be placed where it jumps from ring G to C, reversed back to F, and then discharges from A,
        we simply reverse the sublist [C,D,E,F], leaving us with::

            [A,B,F,E,D,C,G,H]


        A less-complex, more standard convergent-divergent scheme is a subcase of this, where the
        sublist [A,B,C,D,E] or so is reversed, leaving::

            [E,D,C,B,A,F,G,H]


        So the task of this function is simply to determine what subsection, if any, to reverse of
        the baselist.

        Parameters
        ----------
        chargeRing : int, optional
            The peripheral ring into which an assembly enters the core. Default is outermost ring.

        dischargeRing : int, optional
            The last ring an assembly sits in before discharging. Default is jumpRing-1

        jumpRingFrom : int
            The last ring an assembly sits in before jumping to the center

        jumpRingTo : int, optional
            The inner ring into which a jumping assembly jumps. Default is 1.

        coarseFactor : float, optional
            A number between 0 and 1 where 0 hits all rings and 1 only hits the outer, rJ, center, and rD rings.
            This allows coarse shuffling, with large jumps. Default: 0

        Returns
        -------
        ringSchedule : list
            A list of rings in order from discharge to charge.

        ringWidths : list
            A list of integers corresponding to the ringSchedule determining the widths of each ring area

        Examples
        -------
        >>> f.buildRingSchedule(17,1,jumpRingFrom=14)
        ([13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 14, 15, 16, 17],
