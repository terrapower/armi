def applyFuelDisplacement(block, displacementInCm):
    r"""
    Expands the fuel radius in a pin by a number of cm.

    Assumes there's thermal bond in it to displace.
    This adjusts the dimension of the fuel while conserving its mass.

    The bond mass is not conserved; it is assumed to be pushed up into the plenum
    but the modeling of this is not done yet by this method.

    .. warning:: A 0.5% buffer is included to avoid overlaps. This should be analyzed
        in detail as a methodology before using in any particular analysis.

    .. math::

        n V = n\prime V\prime
        n\prime = \frac{V}{V\prime} n

def gasConductivityCorrection(tempInC: float, porosity: float, morphology: int = 2):
    """
    Calculate the correction to conductivity for a porous, gas-filled solid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tempInC
        temperature in celcius
    porosity
        fraction of open/total volume
    morphology, optional
        correlation to use regarding pore morphology (default 2 is irregular
        porosity for conservatism)

    Returns
    -------
    chi : float
        correction to conductivity due to porosity (should be multiplied)

    Notes
    -----
    Morphology is treated different by different models:

    0, no porosity correction
    1, bauer equation, spherical porosity
    2, bauer equation, irregular porosity
    3, bauer equation, mixed morphology, above 660, spherical. Below 660, irregular
    4, maxwell-eucken equation, beta=1.5
