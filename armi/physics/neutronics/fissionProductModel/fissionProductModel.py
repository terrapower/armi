Fission product model

All blocks have a _lumpedFissionProducts attribute that points to a
:py:class:`~armi.physics.neutronics.fissionProductModel.lumpedFissionProduct.LumpedFissionProductCollection`.
The LFP collection may be global or each block may have its own.
The collection may have multiple LFPs from various parents or just one single one.
This module is the shepherd of the block's _lumpedFissionProducts attribute.
All other modules can just assume there's a LFP collection and use it as needed.


Examples

    lfp = fpInterface.getGlobalLumpedFissionProducts()
