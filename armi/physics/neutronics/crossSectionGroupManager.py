Cross section group manager handles burnup-dependent properties of microscopic cross sections.

Blocks are specified to be in a certain *cross section type* and *burnup group*. Together,
these form the *cross section group*. By advancing blocks by their burnup into
different groups, we capture some of the physical effects related to depletion.

XS types are typically single capital letters like A
BU groups are also capital letters.
A XS group of AB is in XS type ``A`` and burnup group ``B``.

This module groups the blocks according to their XS groups and can determine
which block is to be deemed **representative** of an entire set of blocks in a particular xs group.
Then the representative block is sent to a lattice physics kernel for actual physics
calculations.

Generally, the cross section manager is a attribute of the lattice physics code interface (e.g.
the :py:mod:`~terrapower.physics.neutronics.mc2.mc2Interface`.

Examples
--------

    csm = CrossSectionGroupManager()
    csm._setBuGroupBounds(cs['buGroups'])
    csm._addXsGroupsFromBlocks(blockList)
    csm.createRepresentativeBlocks()
    representativeBlockList = csm.representativeBlocks.values()
    blockThatRepresentsBA = csm.representativeBlocks['BA']
