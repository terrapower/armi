def calcReactionRates(obj, keff, lib):
    r"""
    Compute 1-group reaction rates for this object (usually a block.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : Block
        The object to compute reaction rates on. Notionally this could be upgraded to be
        any kind of ArmiObject but with params defined as they are it currently is only
        implemented for a block.

    keff : float
        The keff of the core. This is required to get the neutron production rate correct
        via the neutron balance statement (since nuSigF has a 1/keff term).

    lib : XSLibrary
        Microscopic cross sections to use in computing the reaction rates.

    Notes
    -----
    Values include:

    * Fission
    * nufission
    * n2n
    * absorption

    Scatter could be added as well. This function is quite slow so it is
    skipped for now as it is uncommonly needed.

    Reaction rates are:

    .. math::

        \Sigma \phi = \sum_{\text{nuclides}} \sum_{\text{energy}} \Sigma \phi

    The units of :math:`N \sigma \phi` are::

        [#/bn-cm] * [bn] * [#/cm^2/s] = [#/cm^3/s]

    The group-averaged microscopic cross section is:

    .. math::

        \sigma_g = \frac{\int_{E g}^{E_{g+1}} \phi(E)  \sigma(E) dE}{\int_{E_g}^{E_{g+1}} \phi(E) dE}
