    A short-lived object that coordinates the prep, execution, and processing of a flux solve.

    There are many forms of global flux solves:

    * Eigenvalue/Fixed source
    * Adjoint/real
    * Diffusion/PN/SN/MC
    * Finite difference/nodal

    There are also many reasons someone might need a flux solve:

    * Update multigroup flux and power on reactor and compute keff
    * Just compute keff in a temporary perturbed state
    * Just compute flux and adjoint flux on a state to

    There may also be some required transformations when a flux solve is done:

    * Add/remove edge assemblies
    * Apply a uniform axial mesh

    There are also I/O performance complexities, including running on fast local paths
    and copying certain user-defined files back to the working directory on error
    or completion. Given all these options and possible needs for information from
    global flux, this class provides a unified interface to everything.
