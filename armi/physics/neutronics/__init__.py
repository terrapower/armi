"""
The neutronics physics package in the ARMI framework.

Neutronics encompasses the modeling of nuclear chain reactions and their associated transmutation and decay.

The ARMI Framework comes with a neutronics plugin that introduces two
independent interfaces:

:py:mod:`~armi.physics.neutronics.fissionProductModel`
    Handles fission product modeling

:py:mod:`~armi.physics.neutronics.crossSectionGroupManager`
    Handles the management of different cross section "groups"

.. warning:: There is also some legacy and question-raising code in this module that
    is here temporarily while we finish untangling some of the neutronics
    plugins outside of ARMI.
