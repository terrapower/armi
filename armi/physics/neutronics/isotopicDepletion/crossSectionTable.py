Module containing the CrossSectionTable class.

The CrossSectionTable is useful for performing isotopic depletion analysis by storing one-group
cross sections of interest to such an analysis. This used to live alongside the
isotopicDepletionInterface, but that proved to be an unpleasant coupling between the ARMI composite
model and the physics code contained therein. Separating it out at least means that the composite
model doesn't need to import the isotopicDepletionInterface to function.

    Generate a reaction rate table for given nuclides.

        reactions.
        :id: I_ARMI_DEPL_TABLES0
        :implements: R_ARMI_DEPL_TABLES

        For a given composite object ``obj`` and a list of nuclides ``nuclides`` in that object,
        call ``obj.getReactionRates()`` for each nuclide with a ``nDensity`` parameter of 1.0. If
        ``nuclides`` is not specified, use a list of all nuclides in ``obj``. This will reach
        upwards through the parents of ``obj`` to the associated
        :py:class:`~armi.reactor.reactors.Core` object and pull the ISOTXS library that is stored
        there. If ``obj`` does not belong to a ``Core``, a warning is printed.

        For each child of ``obj``, use the ISOTXS library and the cross-section ID for the
        associated block to produce a reaction rate dictionary in units of inverse seconds for the
        nuclide specified in the original call to ``obj.getReactionRates()``. Because ``nDensity``
        was originally specified as 1.0, this dictionary actually represents the reaction rates per
        unit volume. If the nuclide is not in the ISOTXS library, a warning is printed.

        Combine the reaction rates for all nuclides into a combined dictionary by summing together
        reaction rates of the same type on the same isotope from each of the children of ``obj``.

        If ``obj`` has a non-zero multi-group flux, sum the group-wise flux into the total flux and
        normalize the reaction rates by the total flux, producing a one-group macroscopic cross
        section for each reaction type on each nuclide. Store these values in a
        :py:class:`~armi.physics.neutronics.isotopicDepletion.crossSectionTable.CrossSectionTable`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nuclides : list, optional
        list of nuclide names for which to generate the cross-section table.
        If absent, use all nuclides obtained by self.getNuclides().

    Notes
    -----
    This also used to do some caching on the block level but that has been removed
    and the calls to this may therefore need to be re-optimized.
