The data structures and schema of the cross section modeling options.

These are advanced/compound settings that are carried along in the normal cs
object but aren't simple key/value pairs.

The cs object could either hold the base data (dicts) and create instances
of these data structure objects as needed, or the settings system could actually
hold instances of these data structures. It is most convenient to let the cs
object hold actual instances of these data.

    Cross section modeling options for a particular XS ID.

    Attributes
    ----------
    xsID : str
        Cross section ID that is two characters maximum (i.e., AA).

    geometry: str
        The geometry modeling approximation for regions of the core with
        this assigned xsID. This is required if the ``xsFileLocation``
        attribute is not provided. This cannot be set if the ``xsFileLocation``
        is provided.

    xsFileLocation: list of str or None
        This should be a list of paths where the cross sections for this
        xsID can be copied from. This is required if the ``geometry``
        attribute is not provided. This cannot be set if the ``geometry``
        is provided.

    fluxFileLocation: str or None
        This should be a path where a pre-calculated flux solution
        for this xsID can be copied from. The ``geometry`` attribute
        must be provided with this input.

    validBlockTypes: str or None
        This is a configuration option for how the cross section group manager
        determines which blocks/regions to manage as part of the same collection
        for the current xsID. If this is set to ``None`` then all blocks/regions
        with the current xsID will be considered.

    blockRepresentation : str
        This is a configuration option for how the cross section group manager
        will select how to create a representative block based on the collection
        within the same xsID. See: ``crossSectionGroupManager.BLOCK_COLLECTIONS``.

    driverID : str
        This is a lattice physics configuration option used to determine which
        representative block can be used as a "fixed source" driver for another
        composition. This is particularly useful for non-fuel or highly subcritical
        regions.

    criticalBuckling : bool
        This is a lattice physics configuration option used to enable or disable
        the critical buckling search option.

    nuclideReactionDriver : str
        This is a lattice physics configuration option that is similar to the
        ``driverID``, but rather than applying the source from a specific
        representative block, the neutron source is taken from a single
        nuclides fission spectrum (i.e., U235). This is particularly useful
        for configuring SERPENT 2 lattice physics calculations.

    externalDriver : bool
        This is a lattice physics configuration option that can be used
        to determine if the fixed source problem is internally driven
        or externally driven by the ``driverID`` region. Externally
        driven means that the region will be placed on the outside of the
        current xsID block/region. If this is False then the driver
        region will be "inside" (i.e., an inner ring in a cylindrical
        model).

    useHomogenizedBlockComposition : bool
        This is a lattice physics configuration option that is useful for
        modeling spatially dependent problems (i.e., 1D/2D). If this is
        True then the representative block for the current xsID will be
        be a homogenized region. If this is False then the block will be
        represented in the geometry type selected. This is mainly used for
        1D cylindrical problems.

    numInternalRings : int
        This is a lattice physics configuration option that is used to
        specify the number of grid-based rings for the representative block.

    numExternalRings : int
        This is a lattice physics configuration option that is used to
        specify the number of grid-based rings for the driver block.

    mergeIntoClad : list of str
        This is a lattice physics configuration option that is a list of component
        names to merge into a "clad" component. This is highly-design specific
        and is sometimes used to merge a "gap" or low-density region into
        a "clad" region to avoid numerical issues.

    meshSubdivisionsPerCm : float
        This is a lattice physics configuration option that can be used to control
        subregion meshing of the representative block in 1D problems.

    xsExecuteExclusive : bool
        The mpi task that results from this xsID will reserve a full processor and
        no others will allocate to it. This is useful for time balancing when you
        have one task that takes much longer than the others.

    xsPriority:
        The priority of the mpi tasks that results from this xsID. Lower priority
        will execute first. starting longer jobs first is generally more efficient.

    xsMaxAtomNumber : int
        The maximum atom number to model for infinite dilute isotopes in lattice physics.
        This is used to avoid modeling isotopes with a large atomic number
        (e.g., fission products) as a depletion product of an isotope with a much
        smaller atomic number.

    minDriverDensity: float
        The minimum number density for nuclides included in driver material for a 1D
        lattice physics model.

    Notes
    -----
    Not all default attributes may be useful for your specific application and you may
    require other types of configuration options. These are provided as examples since
    the base ``latticePhysicsInterface`` does not implement models that use these. For
    additional options, consider subclassing the base ``Setting`` object and using this
    model as a template.
