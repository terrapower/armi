"""
The data structures and schema of the cross section modeling options.

These are advanced/compound settings that are carried along in the normal cs
object but aren't simple key/value pairs. 

The cs object could either hold the base data (dicts) and create instances
of these data structure objects as needed, or the settings system could actually
hold instances of these data structures. It is most convenient to let the cs
object hold actual instances of these data.

See detailed docs in `:doc: Lattice Physics <reference/physics/neutronics/latticePhysics/latticePhysics>`.
