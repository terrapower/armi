        Builds G-vectors of the basic XS ('nGamma','fission','nalph','np','n2n','nd','nt')
        Builds GxG matrices for scatter matrices

        Parameters
        ----------
        lib : library object , optional
            If lib is specified, then buildMacros will build macro XS using micro XS data from lib.
            If lib = None, then buildMacros will use the existing library self.r.core.lib. If that does
            not exist, then buildMacros will use a new nuclearDataIO.ISOTXS object.

        buildScatterMatrix : Boolean, optional
            If True, all macro XS will be built, including the time-consuming scatter matrix.
            If False, only the macro XS that are needed for fluxRecon.computePinMGFluxAndPower
            will be built. These include 'transport', 'fission', and a few others. No ng x ng
            matrices (such as 'scatter' or 'chi') will be built. Essentially, this option
            saves huge runtime for the fluxRecon module.

        buildOnlyCoolant : Boolean, optional
            If True, homogenized macro XS will be built only for NA-23.
            If False, the function runs normally.

        libType : str, optional
            The block attribute containing the desired microscopic XS for this block:
            either "micros" for neutron XS or "gammaXS" for gamma XS.
