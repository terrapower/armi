"""
Migrate compound cross section settings from blueprints file to settings file.

This setting was originally stored in blueprints just because yaml was more
conducive than XML for a compound setting. After we migrated the settings
system to YAML, it was much more natural to put this setting in the settings 
file. Along the way, we renamed some of the input fields as well. 

This deletes the ``cross sections`` section from the blueprints file
and adds a valid one into the settings file. 

It manually reads the blueprints file rather than parsing it to ensure
round-trippiness even with yaml-native links.
