Interfaces are objects of code that interact with ARMI. They read information off the state,
perform calculations (or run external codes), and then store the results back in the state.

class STACK_ORDER:  # pylint: disable=invalid-name, too-few-public-methods
    """
    Constants that help determine the order of modules in the interface stack.

    Each module specifies an ``ORDER`` constant that specifies where in this order it
    should be placed in the Interface Stack.

    Notes
    -----
    Originally, the ordering was accomplished with a very large if/else construct in ``createInterfaces``.
    This made more modular by moving the add/activate logic into each module and replacing the if/else with
    just a large hard-coded list of modules in order that could possibly be added. That hard-coded
    list presented ``ImportError`` problems when building various subset distributions of ARMI so this ordering
    mechanism was created to replace it, allowing the modules to define their required order internally.

    Future improvements may include simply defining what information is required to perform a calculation
    and figuring out the ordering from that. It's complex because in coupled simulations, everything
    depends on everything.
