The standard ARMI operator.

This builds and maintains the interface stack and loops through it for a
certain number of cycles with a certain number of timenodes per cycle.

This is analogous to a real reactor operating over some period of time,
often from initial startup, through the various cycles, and out to
the end of plant life.

    Orchestrates an ARMI run, building all the pieces, looping through the interfaces, and manipulating the reactor.

    This Standard Operator loops over a user-input number of cycles, each with a
    user-input number of subcycles (called time nodes). It calls a series of
    interaction hooks on each of the
    :py:class:`~armi.interfaces.Interface` in the Interface Stack.

    Attributes
    ----------
    cs : CaseSettings object
            Global settings that define the run.

    cycleLengths : list
        The duration of each individual cycle in a run (in days). This is the entire cycle,
        from startup to startup and includes outage time.

    availabilityFactors : list
        The fraction of time in a cycle that the plant is producing power. Note that capacity factor
        is always less than or equal to this, depending on the power fraction achieved during each cycle.

    powerFractions : list
        The fraction of full rated capacity that the plant achieves while it is online in each cycle.
        Zero power fraction can indicate decay-only cycles.

    interfaces : list
        The Interface objects that will operate upon the reactor

        Dynamically discover all available interfaces and call their factories, potentially adding

        An operator contains an ordered list of interfaces. These communicate between
        the core ARMI structure and auxiliary computational modules and/or external codes.
        At specified interaction points in a run, the list of interfaces is executed.

        Each interface optionally defines interaction "hooks" for each of the interaction points.
        The normal interaction points are BOL, BOC, every node, EOC, and EOL. If an interface defines
        an interactBOL method, that will run at BOL, and so on.

        The majority of ARMI capabilities lie within interfaces, and this architecture provides
        much of the flexibility of ARMI.

        Order matters.

            the interface to add

            as a group after all other interfaces.
            This allows something to run first at BOL and last at EOL, etc.
        enabled : bool, optional
            If enabled, will run at all hooks. If not, won't run any (with possible exception at BOL, see bolForce).
            Whenever possible, Interfaces that are needed during runtime for some peripheral
            operation but not during the main loop should be instantiated by the
            part of the code that actually needs the interface.
        bolForce: bool, optional
            If true, will run at BOL hook even if disabled. This is often a sign
            that the interface in question should be ephemerally instantiated on demand
            rather than added to the interface stack at all.
