The standard ARMI operator.

This builds and maintains the interface stack and loops through it for a
certain number of cycles with a certain number of timenodes per cycle.

This is analogous to a real reactor operating over some period of time,
often from initial startup, through the various cycles, and out to
the end of plant life.

    Orchestrates an ARMI run, building all the pieces, looping through the interfaces, and manipulating the reactor.

    This Standard Operator loops over a user-input number of cycles, each with a
    user-input number of subcycles (called time nodes). It calls a series of
    interaction hooks on each of the
    :py:class:`~armi.interfaces.Interface` in the Interface Stack.

    Attributes
    ----------
    cs : CaseSettings object
            Global settings that define the run.

    cycleNames : list of str
        The name of each cycle. Cycles without a name are `None`.

    stepLengths : list of list of float
        A two-tiered list, where primary indices correspond to cycle and
        secondary indices correspond to the length of each intra-cycle step (in days).

    cycleLengths : list of float
        The duration of each individual cycle in a run (in days). This is the entire cycle,
        from startup to startup and includes outage time.

    burnSteps : list of int
        The number of sub-cycles in each cycle.

    availabilityFactors : list of float
        The fraction of time in a cycle that the plant is producing power. Note that capacity factor
        is always less than or equal to this, depending on the power fraction achieved during each cycle.
        Note that this is not a two-tiered list like stepLengths or powerFractions,
        because each cycle can have only one availabilityFactor.

    powerFractions : list of list of float
        A two-tiered list, where primary indices correspond to cycles and secondary
        indices correspond to the fraction of full rated capacity that the plant achieves
        during that step of the cycle.
        Zero power fraction can indicate decay-only cycles.

        The Interface objects that will operate upon the reactor

            A method for loading an operator given a database. loadOperator does not
            require an operator prior to loading the state of the reactor. loadState
            does, and therefore armi.init must be called which requires access to the
            blueprints, settings, and geometry files. These files are stored implicitly
            on the database, so loadOperator creates the reactor first, and then attaches
            it to the operator. loadState should be used if you are in the middle
            of an ARMI calculation and need load a different time step. If you are
            loading from a fresh ARMI session, either method is sufficient if you have
            access to all the input files.
