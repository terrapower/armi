A system to check user settings for validity and provide users with meaningful suggestions to fix.

This allows developers to specify a rich set of rules and suggestions for user settings.
These then pop up during initialization of a run, either on the command line or as
dialogues in the GUI. They say things like: "Your ___ setting has the value ___, which
is impossible. Would you like to switch to ___?"
