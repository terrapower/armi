Operators build and hold the ARMI reactor model and perform operations on it.

Different operators may perform different calculation loops upon the reactor model.
Operators can be thought of as schedulers for the interactions between the various
ARMI physics packages and the reactor object(s).

Operators are generally created by a :py:mod:`armi.cases` object and are chosen by
the ``runType`` setting. Custom operators may be introduced via the :py:mod:`armi.plugins` system.

The ARMI framework comes with two general-purpose Operators, which can be used for
very real analysis given a proper set of plugins. The :py:class:`~armi.operators.operator.Operator` 
is the Standard operator, which loops over cycles and timenodes. The 
:py:class:`~armi.operators.snapshots.OperatorSnapshots`
is the Snapshots operator, which loops over specific point in time from a previous Standard run
and performs additional analysis (e.g. for detailed follow-on analysis/transients).
