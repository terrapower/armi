"""
The MPI-aware variant of the standard ARMI operator.

See :py:class:`~armi.operators.operator.Operator` for the parent class.

This sets up the main Operator on the master MPI node and initializes worker
processes on all other MPI nodes. At certain points in the run, particular interfaces
might call into action all the workers. For example, a depletion or
subchannel T/H module may ask the MPI pool to perform a few hundred
independent physics calculations in parallel. In many cases, this can
speed up the overall execution of an analysis manyfold, if a big enough
computer or computer cluster is available. 

Notes
-----
This is not *yet* smart enough to use shared memory when the MPI
tasks are on the same machine. Everything goes through MPI. This can 
be optimized as needed.

        Notes
        -----
        This method is what worker nodes are in while they wait for instructions from
        the master node in a parallel run. The nodes will sit, waiting for a "worker
        command". When this comes (from a bcast from the master), a set of if statements
        are evaluated, with specific behaviors defined for each command. If the operator
        doesn't understand the command, it loops through the interface stack to see if
        any of the interfaces understand it.

        Originally, "magic strings" were broadcast, which were handled either here or in
        one of the interfaces' ``workerOperate`` methods. Since then, the
        :py:mod:`~armi.mpiActions` system has been devised which just broadcasts
        ``MpiAction`` objects. Both methods are still supported.
