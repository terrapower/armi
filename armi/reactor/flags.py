Handles *flags* that formally bind certain categories to reactor parts.

``Flags`` are used to formally categorize the various ``ArmiObject`` objects that make
up a reactor model. These categories allow parts of the ARMI system to treat different
Assemblies, Blocks, Components, etc. differently.

By default, the specific Flags that are bound to each object are derived by that
object's name when constructed; if the name contains any valid flag names, those Flags
will be assigned to the object. However, specific Flags may be specified within
blueprints, in which case the name is ignored and only the explicitly-requested Flags
are applied (see :doc:`/user/inputs/blueprints` for more details).

Individual Flags tend to be various nouns and adjectives that describe common objects
that go into a reactor (e.g. "fuel", "shield", "control", "duct", "plenum", etc.). In
addition, there are some generic Flags (e.g., "A", "B", "C", etc.) that aid in
disambiguating between objects that need to be targeted separately but would otherwise
have the same Flags. Flags are stored as integer bitfields within the parameter system,
allowing them to be combined arbitrarily on any ARMI object. Since they are stored in
bitfields, each new flag definition requires widening this bitfield; therefore, the
number of defined Flags should be kept relatively small, and each flag should provide
maximum utility.

Within the code, Flags are usually combined into a "type specification (``TypeSpec``)",
which is either a single combination of Flags, or a list of Flag combinations. More
information about how ``TypeSpec`` is interpreted can be found in
:py:meth:`armi.reactor.composites.ArmiObject.hasFlags`.

Flags are intended to describe `what something is`, rather than `what something should
do`. Historically, Flags have been used to do both, which has led to confusion. The
binding of specific behavior to certain Flags should ideally be controlled through
settings with reasonable defaults, rather than being hard-coded. Currently, much of the
code still uses hard-coded ``TypeSpecs``, and certain Flags are clearly saying `what
something should do` (e.g., ``Flags.DEPLETABLE``).

.. note::
    Flags have a rather storied history. Way back when, code that needed to operate on
    specific objects would do substring searches against object names to decide if they
    were relevant. This was very prone to error, and led to all sorts of surprising
    behavior based on the names used in input files. To improve the situation, Flags
    were developed to better formalize which strings mattered, and to define canonical
    names for things. Still almost all flag checks were hard-coded, and
    aside from up-front error checks, many of the original issues persisted. For
    instance, developing a comprehensive manual of which Flags lead to which behavior
    was very difficult.

    Migrating the `meaning` of Flags into settings will allow us to better document how
    those Flags/settings affect ARMI's behavior.

    As mentioned above, plenty of code still hard-codes Flag ``TypeSpecs``, and certain
    Flags do not follow the `what something is` convention. Future work should improve
    upon this as possible.


Things that Flags are used for include:

* **Fuel management**: Different kinds of assemblies (LTAs, fuel, reflectors) have
  different shuffling operations and must be distinguished. Certain blocks in an
  assembly are stationary, and shouldn't be moved along with the rest of the assembly
  when shuffling is performed. Filtering for stationary blocks can also be done using
  Flags (e.g., ``Flags.GRID_PLATE``).

* **Fuel performance**: Knowing what's fuel (``Flags.FUEL``) and what isn't (e.g.,
  ``Flags.PLENUM``) is important to figure out what things to grow and where to move
  fission gas to.

* **Fluid fuel** reactors need to find all the fuel that ever circulates through the
  reactor so it can be depleted with the average flux.

* **Core Mechanical** analyses often need to know if an object is solid, fluid, or void
  (material subclassing can handle this).

* **T/H** needs to find the pin bundle in different kinds of assemblies (*radial shield*
  block in *radial shield* assemblies, *fuel* in *fuel*, etc.). Also needs to generate
  3-layer pin models with pin (fuel/control/shield/slug), then gap (liners/gap/bond),
  then clad.


Examples
--------
>>> block.hasFlags(Flags.PRIMARY | Flags.TEST | Flags.FUEL)
True

>>> block.hasFlags([Flags.PRIMARY, Flags.TEST, Flags.FUEL])
True

>>> block.getComponent(Flags.INTERDUCTCOOLANT)
<component InterDuctCoolant>

>>> block.getComponents(Flags.FUEL)
[<component fuel1>, <component fuel2>, ...]
