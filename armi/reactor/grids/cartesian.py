class CartesianGrid(StructuredGrid):
    """
    Grid class representing a conformal Cartesian mesh.

    It is recommended to call :meth:`fromRectangle` to construct,
    rather than directly constructing with ``__init__``

    Notes
    -----
    In Cartesian, (i, j, k) indices map to (x, y, z) coordinates.
    In an axial plane (i, j) are as follows::

        (-1, 1) ( 0, 1) ( 1, 1)
        (-1, 0) ( 0, 0) ( 1, 0)
        (-1,-1) ( 0,-1) ( 1,-1)

    The concepts of ring and position are a bit tricker in Cartesian grids than in Hex,
    because unlike in the Hex case, there is no guaranteed center location. For example,
    when using a CartesianGrid to lay out assemblies in a core, there is only a single
    central location if the number of assemblies in the core is odd-by-odd; in an
    even-by-even case, there are four center-most assemblies. Therefore, the number of
    locations per ring will vary depending on the "through center" nature of
    ``symmetry``.

    Furthermore, notice that in the "through center" (odd-by-odd) case, the central
    index location, (0,0) is typically centered at the origin (0.0, 0.0), whereas with
    the "not through center" (even-by-even) case, the (0,0) index location is offset,
    away from the origin.

    These concepts are illustrated in the example drawings below.

    .. figure:: ../.static/through-center.png
        :width: 400px
        :align: center

        Grid example where the axes pass through the "center assembly" (odd-by-odd).
        Note that ring 1 only has one location in it.

    .. figure:: ../.static/not-through-center.png
        :width: 400px
        :align: center

        Grid example where the axes lie between the "center assemblies" (even-by-even).
        Note that ring 1 has four locations, and that the center of the (0, 0)-index
        location is offset from the origin.
