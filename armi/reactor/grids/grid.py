    Most work will be done with structured grids, e.g., hexagonal grid, Cartesian grids,

    a Cartesian grid but with variable stepping between cells, where ``dx`` may not be
    constant.

    So here, we define an interface so things that rely on grids can worry less
    about how the location data are stored.
