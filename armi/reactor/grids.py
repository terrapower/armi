This contains structured meshes in multiple geometries and spatial locators (i.e. locations).

:py:class:`Grids <Grid>` are objects that map indices (i, j, k) to spatial locations
(x,y,z) or (t,r,z).  They are useful for arranging things in reactors, such as:

* Fuel assemblies in a reactor
* Plates in a heat exchanger
* Pins in a fuel assembly
* Blocks in a fuel assembly (1-D)

Fast reactors often use a hexagonal grid, while other reactors may be better suited for
Cartesian or RZT grids. This module contains representations of all these.

``Grid``\ s can be defined by any arbitrary combination of absolute grid boundaries and
unit step directions.

Associated with grids are :py:class:`IndexLocations <IndexLocation>`. Each of these maps
to a single cell in a grid, or to an arbitrary point in the continuous space represented
by a grid. When a `Grid`` is built, it builds a collection of ``IndexLocation``\ s, one
for each cell.

In the ARMI :py:mod:`armi.reactor` module, each object is assigned a locator either from
a grid or in arbitrary, continuous space (using a :py:class:`CoordinateLocation`) on the
``spatialLocator`` attribute.

Below is a basic example of how to use a 2-D grid::

>>> grid = CartesianGrid.fromRectangle(1.0, 1.0)  # 1 cm square-pitch Cartesian grid
>>> location = grid[1,2,0]
>>> location.getGlobalCoordinates()
array([ 1.,  2.,  0.])

Grids can be chained together in a parent-child relationship. This is often used in ARMI
where a 1-D axial grid (e.g. in an assembly) is being positioned in a core or spent-fuel
pool. See example in
:py:meth:`armi.reactor.tests.test_grids.TestSpatialLocator.test_recursion`.

The "radial" (ring, position) indexing used in DIF3D can be converted to and from the
more quasi-Cartesian indexing in a hex mesh easily with the utility methods
:py:meth:`HexGrid.getRingPos` and :py:func:`indicesToRingPos`.

This module is designed to satisfy the spatial arrangement requirements of :py:mod:`the
Reactor package <armi.reactor>`.

Throughout the module, the term **global** refers to the top-level coordinate system
while the word **local** refers to within the current coordinate system defined by the
current grid.

class Grid:
    """
    A connected set of cells characterized by indices mapping to space and vice versa.

    The cells may be characterized by any mixture of regular repeating steps and
    user-defined steps in any direction.

    For example, a 2-D hex lattice has constant, regular steps whereas a 3-D hex mesh
    may have user-defined axial meshes. Similar for Cartesian, RZT, etc.

    Parameters
    ----------
    unitSteps : tuple of tuples, optional
        Describes the grid spatially as a function on indices.
        Each tuple describes how each ``(x,y,or z)`` dimension is influenced by
        ``(i,j,k)``. In other words, it is::

            (dxi, dxj, jxk), (dyi, dyj, dyk), (dzi, dzj, dzk)

        where ``dmn`` is the distance (in cm) that dimension ``m`` will change as a
                function of index ``n``.
        Unit steps are used as a generic method for defining repetitive grids in a
        variety of geometries, including hexagonal and Cartesian.  The tuples are not
        vectors in the direction of the translation, but rather grouped by direction. If
        the bounds argument is described for a direction, the bounds will be used rather
        than the unit step information.  The default of (0, 0, 0) makes all dimensions
        insensitive to indices since the coordinates are calculated by the dot product
        of this and the indices.  With this default, any dimension that is desired to
        change with indices should be defined with bounds. RZtheta grids are created
        exclusively with bounds.

    bounds : 3-tuple
        Absolute increasing bounds in cm including endpoints of a non-uniform grid.
        Each item represents the boundaries in the associated direction.  Use Nones when
        unitSteps should be applied instead. Most useful for thetaRZ grids or other
        non-uniform grids.

    unitStepLimits : 3-tuple
        The limit of the steps in all three directions. This constrains step-defined
        grids to be finite so we can populate them with SpatialLocator objects.

    offset : 3-tuple, optional
        Offset in cm for each axis. By default the center of the (0,0,0)-th object is in
        the center of the grid.  Offsets can move it so that the (0,0,0)-th object can
        be fully within a quadrant (i.e. in a Cartesian grid).

    armiObject : ArmiObject, optional
        The ArmiObject that this grid describes. For example if it's a 1-D assembly
        grid, the armiObject is the assembly. Note that ``self.armiObject.spatialGrid``
        is ``self``.

    Examples
    --------
    A 2D a rectangular grid with width (x) 2 and height (y) 3 would be::

    >>> grid = Grid(unitSteps=((2, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0),(0, 0, 0)))

    A regular hex grid with pitch 1 is::

    >>> grid = Grid(unitSteps= ((sqrt(3)/2, 0.0, 0.0), (0.5, 1.0, 0.0), (0, 0, 0))

    .. note:: For this unit hex the magnitude of the vector constructed using the
              0th index of each tuple is 1.0.

    Notes
    -----
    Each dimension must either be defined through unitSteps or bounds.
    The combination of unitSteps with bounds was settled upon after some struggle to
    have one unified definition of a grid (i.e. just bounds). A hexagonal grid is
    somewhat challenging to represent with bounds because the axes are not orthogonal,
    so a unit-direction vector plus bounds would be required. And then the bounds would
    be wasted space because they can be derived simply by unit steps. Memory efficiency
    is important in this object so the compact representation of
    unitSteps-when-possible, bounds-otherwise was settled upon.

    Design considerations include:

    * unitSteps are more intuitive as operations starting from the center of a cell,
      particularly with hexagons and rectangles. Otherwise the 0,0 position of a hexagon
      in the center of 1/3-symmetric hexagon is at the phantom bottom left of the
      hexagon.

    * Users generally prefer to input mesh bounds rather than centers (e.g. starting at
      0.5 instead of 0.0 in a unit mesh is weird).

    * If we store bounds, computing bounds is simple and computing centers takes ~2x the
      effort. If we store centers, it's the opposite.

    * Regardless of how we store things, we'll need a Grid that has the lower-left
      assembly fully inside the problem (i.e. for full core Cartesian) as well as
      another one that has the lower-left assembly half-way or quarter-way sliced off
      (for 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 symmetries).  The ``offset`` parameter handles this.

    * Looking up mesh boundaries (to define a mesh in another code) is generally more
      common than looking up centers (for plotting or measuring distance).

    * A grid can be anchored to the object that it is in with a backreference. This
      gives it the ability to traverse the composite tree and map local to global
      locations without having to duplicate the composite pattern on grids. This remains
      optional so grids can be used for non-reactor-package reasons.  It may seem
      slightly cleaner to set the armiObject to the parent's spatialLocator itself
      but the major disadvantage of this is that when an object moves, the armiObject
      would have to be updated. By anchoring directly to Composite objects, the parent
      is always up to date no matter where or how things get moved.

    * Unit step calculations use dot products and must not be polluted by the bound
      indices. Thus we reduce the size of the unitSteps tuple accordingly.
