        There is a coupling between block heights, the parent assembly axial mesh,
        and the ztop/zbottom/z params of the sibling blocks. When you set a height,
        all those things are invalidated. Thus, this method has to go through and
        update them via ``parent.calculateZCoords``. This could be inefficient
        though it has not been identified as a bottleneck. Possible improvements
        include deriving z/ztop/zbottom on the fly and invalidating the parent mesh
        with some kind of flag, signaling it to recompute itself on demand.
        Developers can get around some of the O(N^2) scaling of this by setting
        ``p.height`` directly but they must know to update the dependent objects
        after they do that. Use with care.

            are copied onto the homogenized block (e.g., macros, lumped fission products, burnup group,

        Notes
        -----
        This can be used to improve performance when a new copy of a reactor needs to be
        built, but the full detail of the block (including component geometry, material,
        number density, etc.) is not required for the targeted physics solver being applied
        to the new reactor model.

        The main use case is for the uniform mesh converter (UMC). Frequently, a deterministic
        neutronics solver will require a uniform mesh reactor, which is produced by the UMC.
        Many deterministic solvers for fast spectrum reactors will also treat the individual
        blocks as homogenized mixtures. Since the neutronics solver does not need to know about
        the geometric and material details of the individual child components within a block,
        we can save significant effort while building the uniform mesh reactor with the UMC
        by omitting this detailed data and only providing the necessary level of detail for
        the uniform mesh reactor: number densities on each block.

        Individual components within a block can have different temperatures, and this
        can affect cross sections. This temperature variation is captured by the lattice physics
        module. As long as temperature distribution is correctly captured during cross section
        generation, it doesn't need to be transferred to the neutronics solver directly through
        this copy operation.

        If you make a new block, you must add it to an assembly and a reactor.
