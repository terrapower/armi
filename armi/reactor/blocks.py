        Notes
        -----
        There is a coupling between block heights, the parent assembly axial mesh,
        and the ztop/zbottom/z params of the sibling blocks. When you set a height,
        all those things are invalidated. Thus, this method has to go through and
        update them via ``parent.calculateZCoords``. This could be inefficient
        though it has not been identified as a bottleneck. Possible improvements
        include deriving z/ztop/zbottom on the fly and invalidating the parent mesh
        with some kind of flag, signaling it to recompute itself on demand.
        Developers can get around some of the O(N^2) scaling of this by setting
        ``p.height`` directly but they must know to update the dependent objects
        after they do that. Use with care.

        Rotate an assembly, which means rotating the indexing of pins.

        Notes
        -----
        Changing (x,y) positions of pins does NOT constitute rotation, because the indexing of pin
        atom densities must be re-ordered.  Re-order indexing of pin-level quantities, NOT (x,y)
        locations of pins.  Otherwise, subchannel input will be in wrong order.

        How rotations works is like this. There are pins with unique pin numbers in each block.
        These pin numbers will not change no matter what happens to a block, so if you have pin 1,
        you always have pin 1. However, these pins are all in pinLocations, and these are what
        change with rotations. At BOL, a pin's pinLocation is equal to its pin number, but after
        a rotation, this will no longer be so.

        So, all params that don't care about exactly where in space the pin is (such as depletion)
        can just use the pin number, but anything that needs to know the spatial location (such as
        fluxRecon, which interpolates the flux spatially, or subchannel codes, which needs to know where the
        power is) need to map through the pinLocation parameters.

        This method rotates the pins by changing the pinLocations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        rotNum : int
            An integer from 0 to 5, indicating the number of counterclockwise 60-degree rotations
            from the CURRENT orientation. Degrees of counter-clockwise rotation = 60*rot

        justCompute : Boolean, optional
            If True, rotateIndexLookup will be returned but NOT assigned to the object variable
            self.rotateIndexLookup.
            If False, rotateIndexLookup will be returned AND assigned to the object variable
            self.rotateIndexLookup.  Useful for figuring out which rotation is best to minimize
            burnup, etc.

        Returns
        -------
        rotateIndexLookup : dict of ints
            This is an index lookup (or mapping) between pin ids and pin locations
            The pin indexing is 1-D (not ring,pos or GEODST).
            The "ARMI pin ordering" is used for location, which is counter-clockwise from 3 o'clock.
            Pin numbers start at 1, pin locations also start at 1.
