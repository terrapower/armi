Utility functions to aid in removing old location objects.

The location module used to store classes and functions that were used to make sense of
where ARMI objects were in space, and relative to each other. This functionality is now
satisfied by the :py:mod:`armi.reactor.grids` module and its Grid and Location objects.

This module still exists to help satisfy some weird cases where using Grids/Locations
was not easy. This mostly has to do with the concept of ring and position, which are
difficult to reason about in the absence of a Grid instance.

This is pretty weird and nuanced. Cartesian grids need state (``throughCenter``) in
order to reason about ring/pos. So, for ring/pos to be part of the base Grid
abstraction, we need to assume that *any* Grid can only cough up ring/pos information
through an instance method. HexGrid is sort of the special case, in that it *could* do
ring/pos stuff as a static method (notice that it punts the actual implementation to
``hexagon.py``). There is no similar ``rectangle.py`` to hold the concept of ring/pos
for the CartesianGrid case, and to do such a thing would be extra weird, because a
``throughCenter`` doesn't really mean anything to a simple rectangle; the grid carries
the meaning of ``throughCenter``.

So in the rare circumstances where we want to know about ring/pos from a block/assembly
that may or may not actually live in a Grid, we need to just make assumptions and grab
something. In the hex case, that something can be ``hexagon.py``, in the Cartesian
case that something are the private static methods unique to
:py:class:`armi.reactor.grids.CartesianGrid`.

Further improvements to the Block and Assembly classes (or more fundamentally with the
``ArmiObject`` class) will likely render this module useless at which point it can and
should be removed. Namely, there are plans to associate simple shape objects with each
``ArmiObject``, which would allow for knowing about the Hex/HexGrid-ness of an object
without it needing to live in a ``.spatialGrid``.

This module also retains the ``Line`` and ``Area`` classes, which at the very least
should be moved somewhere else more relevant.
