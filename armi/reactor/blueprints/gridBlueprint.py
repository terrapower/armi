Input definitions for Grids.

Grids are given names which can be referred to on other input structures
(like core maps and pin maps).

These are in turn interpreted into concrete things at lower levels. For
example:

* Core map lattices get turned into :py:mod:`armi.reactor.grids`,
  which get set to ``core.spatialGrid``.
* Block pin map lattices get applied to the components to provide
  some subassembly spatial details

Lattice inputs here are floating in space. Specific dimensions
and anchor points are handled by the lower-level objects definitions. This
is intended to maximize lattice reusability.
