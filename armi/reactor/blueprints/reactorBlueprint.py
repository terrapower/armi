Definitions of top-level reactor arrangements like the Core (default), SFP, etc.

See documentation of blueprints in :ref:`bp-input-file` for more context. See example in
:py:mod:`armi.reactor.blueprints.tests.test_reactorBlueprints`.

This was built to replace the old system that loaded the core geometry from the ``cs['geometry']``
setting. Until the geom file-based input is completely removed, this system will attempt to migrate
the core layout from geom files. When geom files are used, explicitly specifying a ``core`` system
will result in an error.

System Blueprints are a big step in the right direction to generalize user input, but was still
mostly adapted from the old Core layout input. As such, they still only really support Core-like
systems. Future work should generalize the concept of "system" to more varied scenarios.

        This class creates a yaml interface for the user to define systems with
        grids, such as cores or spent fuel pools, each having their own name,
        type, grid, and position in space. It is incorporated into the "systems"
        section of a blueprints file by being included as key-value pairs within
        the :py:class:`~armi.reactor.blueprints.reactorBlueprint.Systems` class,
        which is in turn included into the overall blueprints within
        :py:class:`~armi.reactor.blueprints.Blueprints`.

        This class includes a
        :py:meth:`~armi.reactor.blueprints.reactorBlueprint.SystemBlueprint.construct` method, which
        is typically called from within :py:func:`~armi.reactor.reactors.factory` during the
        initialization of the reactor object to instantiate the core and/or spent fuel pool objects.
        During that process, a spatial grid is constructed based on the grid blueprints specified in
        the "grids" section of the blueprints (see :need:`I_ARMI_BP_GRID`) and the assemblies needed
        to fill the lattice are built from blueprints using
        :py:meth:`~armi.reactor.blueprints.Blueprints.constructAssem`.

    Notes
    -----
    We use string keys to link grids to objects that use them. This differs from how blocks/
    assembies are specified, which use YAML anchors. YAML anchors have proven to be problematic and
    difficult to work with.
