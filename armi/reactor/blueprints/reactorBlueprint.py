Definitions of top-level reactor arrangements like the Core (default), SFP, etc.

Each structure is defined by a name and a geometry xml file.

See documentation of blueprints in :doc:`/user/inputs/blueprints`.
See example in :py:mod:`armi.reactor.blueprints.tests.test_reactorBlueprints`.

Lattices will form tightly to the pitch of their children by default
but you can spread them out by adding the optional ``lattice pitch`` key.
This can be useful for adding grids with lots of spacing between objects.

This was built on top of an existing system that loaded the core geometry from the
global setting cs['geometry']. This system will still allow that to exist
but will error out if you define ``core`` here and there at the same time.
