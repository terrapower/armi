Definitions of top-level reactor arrangements like the Core (default), SFP, etc.

See documentation of blueprints in :doc:`/user/inputs/blueprints` for more context. See
example in :py:mod:`armi.reactor.blueprints.tests.test_reactorBlueprints`.

This was built to replace the old system that loaded the core geometry from the
cs['geometry'] setting. Until the geom file-based input is completely removed, this
system will attempt to migrate the core layout from geom files. When geom files are
used, explicitly specifying a ``core`` system will result in an error.

System Blueprints are a big step in the right direction to generalize user input, but
was still mostly adapted from the old Core layout input. As such, they still only really
support Core-like systems. Future work should generalize the concept of "system" to more
varied scenarios.
