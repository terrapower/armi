    Notes
    -----
    If componentA and componentB are both solids and the same type, geometric overlap can be checked via
    getCircleInnerDiameter and getBoundingCircleOuterDiameter. Four different cases are accounted for.
    If they do not meet these initial criteria, linkage is assumed to be False.
    Case #1: Unshaped Components. There is no way to determine overlap so they're assumed to be not linked.
    Case #2: Blocks with specified grids. If componentA and componentB have identical grid indices (cannot be a partial
    case, ALL of the indices must be contained by one or the other), then overlap can be checked.
    Case #3: If Component position is not specified via a grid, the multiplicity is checked. If consistent, they are
    assumed to be in the same positions and their overlap is checked.
    Case #4: Components are either not both solids, are not the same type, or Cases 1-3 are not True.
