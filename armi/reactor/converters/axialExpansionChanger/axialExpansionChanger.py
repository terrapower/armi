            :id: I_ARMI_INP_COLD_HEIGHT
            :implements: R_ARMI_INP_COLD_HEIGHT

            This method is designed to be used during core construction to axially thermally expand the
            assemblies to their "hot" temperatures (as determined by ``Thot`` values in blueprints).
            First, The Assembly is prepared for axial expansion via ``setAssembly``. In
            ``applyColdHeightMassIncrease``, the number densities on each Component is adjusted to
            reflect that Assembly inputs are at cold (i.e., ``Tinput``) temperatures. To expand to
            the requested hot temperatures, thermal expansion factors are then computed in
            ``computeThermalExpansionFactors``. Finally, the Assembly is axially thermally expanded in
            ``axiallyExpandAssembly``.

            If the setting ``detailedAxialExpansion`` is ``False``, then each Assembly gets its Block mesh
            set to match that of the "reference" Assembly (see ``getDefaultReferenceAssem`` and ``setBlockMesh``).

            Once the Assemblies are axially expanded, the Block BOL heights are updated. To account for the change in
            Block volume from axial expansion, ``completeInitialLoading`` is called to update any volume-dependent
            Block information.

        Parameters
        ----------
        assems: list[:py:class:`Assembly <armi.reactor.assemblies.Assembly>`]
            list of assemblies to be thermally expanded
        isDetailedAxialExpansion: bool
            If False, assemblies will be forced to conform to the reference mesh after expansion
        referenceAssembly: :py:class:`Assembly <armi.reactor.assemblies.Assembly>`, optional
            Assembly whose mesh other meshes will conform to if isDetailedAxialExpansion is False.
