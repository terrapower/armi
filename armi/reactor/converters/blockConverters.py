        is stored on the component level. In the solute and solvent are the same temperature this is not an issue.
        Converted blocks that have dissolved components should avoid having their temperatures changed.

        may not be consistent with how the components would behave independently. For this reason it is
        recommended that these blocks be made right before the physics calculation of interest and be immediately

    Convert a block and driver block into a block made of a concentric circles using

    -----
    This converter is intended for use in building 1-dimensional models of a set of block.
    numInternalRings controls the number of rings to use for the source block, while the
    numExternalRings controls the number of rings for the driver fuel block.  The number
    of blocks to in each ring grows by 6 for each ring in hex geometry and 8 for each ring
    in Cartesian.

    blocks to add based on the type of the ``sourceBlock``. For example, if the ``sourceBlock``
    is a HexBlock then a HexGrid will be used. If the ``sourceBlock`` is a CartesianBlock
    then a CartesianGrid without an offset will be used.
