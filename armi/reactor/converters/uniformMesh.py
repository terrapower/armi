"""
Converts reactor with arbitrary axial meshing (e.g. multiple assemblies with different
axial meshes) to one with a global uniform axial mesh.

Useful for preparing inputs for physics codes that require structured meshes
from a more flexible ARMI reactor mesh.

This is implemented generically but includes a concrete subclass for
neutronics-specific parameters. This is used for build input files
for codes like DIF3D which require axially uniform meshes.

Requirements
------------
1. Build an average reactor with aligned axial meshes from a reactor with arbitrarily
   unaligned axial meshes in a way that conserves nuclide mass
2. Translate state information computed on the uniform mesh back to the unaligned mesh.
3. For neutronics cases, all neutronics-related block params should be translated, as
   well as the multigroup real and adjoint flux.


.. warning: This procedure can cause numerical diffusion in some cases. For example, 
    if a control rod tip block has a large coolant block below it, things like peak
    absorption rate can get lost into it. We recalculate some but not all 
    reaction rates in the re-mapping process based on a flux remapping. To avoid this,
    finer meshes will help. Always perform mesh sensitivity studies to ensure appropriate
    convergence for your needs.


Examples
--------
converter = uniformMesh.NeutronicsUniformMeshConverter()
converter.convert(reactor)
uniformReactor = converter.convReactor
# do calcs, then:
converter.applyStateToOriginal()

The mesh mapping happens as described in the figure:
