"""
Reads the input files that define where the major systems are and what's in them.

This includes the core-map, showing which assemblies are where in a core,
and may also include a spent fuel pool, pumps, heat exchangers, etc.

The blueprints input files define the low-level dimensions and compositions
of parts, and this file maps those definitions to locations throughout the
reactor model.

It may eventually also describe the pin-maps within assemblies for solid fuel.

Historically, this file was called the "Geometry Input File", but that's too
generic so we changed it to reduce new user confusion.

Where the original geom.xml file had just one set of assemblies
in the core and other systems were pointed to in the blueprints
file, we eventually anticipate moving all systems definitions
to this geometry file.
