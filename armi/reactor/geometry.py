    """
    Enumeration of geometry types.

    Historically, ARMI has used strings to specify and express things like geometry type
    and symmetry conditions. This makes interpretation of user input straightforward,
    but is less ergonomic, less efficient, and more error-prone within the code. For
    instance:
     - is "quarter reflective" the same as "reflective quarter"? Should it be?
     - code that needs to interpret these need to use string operations, which are
       non-trivial compared to enum comparisons.
     - rules about mutual exclusion (hex and Cartesian can't both be used in the same
       context) and composability (geometry type + domain + symmetry type) are harder to
       enforce.

    Instead, we hope to parse user input into a collection of enumerations and use those
    internally throughout the code. Future work should expand this to satisfy all needs
    of the geometry system and refactor to replace use of the string constants.

        Safely convert from string representation, no-op if already an enum instance.

        This is useful as we transition to using enumerations more throughout the code.
        There will remain situations where a geomType may be provided in string or enum
        form, in which the consuming code would have to check the type before
        proceeding. This function serves two useful purposes:
         - Relieve client code from having to if/elif/else on ``isinstance()`` checks
         - Provide a location to instrument these conversions for when we actually try
           to deprecate the strings. E.g., produce a warning when this is called, or
           eventually forbidding the conversion entirely.
