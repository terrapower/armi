This module contains the magic that makes the Parameter system and ARMI composite model
play nicely together.

The contained metaclass is useful for maintaining a hierarchy of ``ParameterCollection``
classes, which mimic the hierarchy of ``ArmiObject`` s to which they apply. Some
``ArmiObject`` subclasses define their own parameters, while others do not, so we do not
want to blindly create a ``ParameterCollectionClass`` for each ``ArmiObject`` subclass.
Instead, we want to be able to skip generations when no additional parameters were
requested for that level. For instance if we have a hierarchy like: ``ArmiObject`` <-
``A`` <- ``B``, where ``ArmiObject`` and ``B`` define parameters, while ``A`` does not
define any parameters of its own, we want to have a ``ArmiObjectParameterCollection``
and a ``BParameterCollection`` (with ``BParameterCollection`` being a subclass of
``ArmiObjectParameterCollection``).  ``ArmiObject`` and ``A`` will both *share* the
``ArmiObjectParameterCollection``, while ``B`` will use ``BParameterCollection``.
``BParameterCollection`` will contain all of the parameters defined in
``ArmiObjectParameterCollection``, plus whatever additional parameters were defined on
``B``.

The above scenario should behave rather intuitively for someone used to classes and
inheritance, but maintaining this hierarchy by hand would be onerous and error-prone.
What if one day we decide to add some parameters to ``A``? We need to remember to add a
new class for its parameters, and make sure to make ``BParameterCollection`` a subclass
of that new ``ParameterCollection`` class. With the below metaclass, we needn't worry
ourselves with any of that; it is taken care of automatically.

If you want to know how the sausage is made, the ``ResolveParametersMeta`` metaclass is
responsible for forming a hierarchy of ``ParameterCollection`` classes that correspond
to the related hierarchy of classes inheriting the root ``ArmiObject`` class. It should
be rare for an ARMI developer not engaged directly with Framework development to need to
know exactly how this works, but a proficient ARMI developer must keep in mind the
following rules about how this system behaves in practice:
    - When defining subclasses of ``ArmiObject``, defining a class attribute called
      ``pDefs`` of the ``ParameterDefinitionCollection`` type signals to the system that
      this is a *Parameter Class*.
    - When defining a *Parameter Class*, it will trigger the creation of a new
      ``ParameterCollection`` class, which will be derived from the
      ``ParameterCollection`` class of the most immediate *Parameter Class* ancestor
      the new class's inheritance tree.
    - All classes derived from ``ArmiObject`` will receive an associated subclass of
      ``ParameterCollection``, which will ultimately include all of the relevant
      Parameters for that class. The specific class is the ``ParameterCollection``
      subclass defined for the most immediate *Parameter Class* in the classes
      inheritance tree.
    - Parameter definitions can be added to a *Parameter Class*'s ``pDefs`` until
      Parameters have been "compiled" for it. After compiling parameters, the ``pDefs``
      are locked, and any attempts at defining additional parameters will cause an
      error.
    - ``ArmiObject`` s cannot be instantiated until after parameters have been compiled.

class ResolveParametersMeta(type):
    """Metaclass for automatically defining associated ParameterCollection classes.

    Any class invoking this metaclass will automatically create an associated sub-class
    of the ``ParameterCollection`` type, if it has a class attribute called ``pDefs``
    that is an instance of ``ParameterDefinitionCollection``. This new class will itself
    be a subclass of the ``ParameterCollection`` class that is associated with the
    invoking class's parent.

    If no ``pDefs`` class attribute is present, the invoking class will adopt the
    ``ParameterCollection`` class associated with it's parent, or ``None`` if it cannot
    find one.

    The associated ``ParameterCollection`` will be stored on the new class's
    ``paramCollectionType`` attribute.

    For example, when this metaclass is applied to the ``Block`` class it will create a
    new class named ``BlockParameterCollection``, and add it as a class attribute called
    ``Block.paramCollectionType``. The ``BlockParameterCollection`` class will itself be
    a subclass of ``ArmiObjectParameterCollection``, which it would have found from the
    ``Composite`` class from which the ``Block`` class inherits. The ``Composite``
    calss, on the other hand, would have obtained the ``ArmiObjectParameterCollection``
    from it's parent (``ArmiObject``), since it does not have a ``pDefs`` attribute of
    its own.
