        As with other ArmiObjects, Assemblies are sorted based on location. Assemblies
        are more permissive in the grid consistency checks to accomodate situations
        where assemblies might be children of the same Core, but not in the same grid as
        each other (as can be the case in the spent fuel or charge fuel pools). In these

        not live in the same grid. It may be beneficial in the future to maintain the
        more strict behavior of ArmiObject's ``__lt__`` implementation once the SFP/CFP

        -----
        This function only conserves mass on certain conditions:

                   depict grid plate shielding Sodium is not conserved.
                b) Fuel blocks only conserve mass of the fuel, not the structure since
                   the fuel slides up through the cladding (thus fuel/cladding should be
                   reduced).
                c) Structure above the assemblies (expected to be plenum) do not
                   conserve mass since plenum regions have their height reduced to
                   conserve the total structure mass when the fuel grows in the
                   cladding.  See b)
            2) Reflectors, shields, and control rods
                a) These assemblies do not conserve mass since they should remain
                   uniform to keep radial shielding accurate. This approach should be
                   conservative.
                b) Control rods do not have their mass conserved and the control rod
