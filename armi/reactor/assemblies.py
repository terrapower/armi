        are more permissive in the grid consistency checks to accomodate situations
        where assemblies might be children of the same Core, but not in the same grid as

        same grid. It may be beneficial in the future to maintain the more strict behavior

        -----
        This function only conserves mass on certain conditions:

                   depict grid plate shielding Sodium is not conserved.
                b) Fuel blocks only conserve mass of the fuel, not the structure since
                   the fuel slides up through the cladding (thus fuel/cladding should be
                   reduced).
                c) Structure above the assemblies (expected to be plenum) do not
                   conserve mass since plenum regions have their height reduced to
                   conserve the total structure mass when the fuel grows in the
                   cladding.  See b)
            2) Reflectors, shields, and control rods
                a) These assemblies do not conserve mass since they should remain
                   uniform to keep radial shielding accurate. This approach should be
                   conservative.
                b) Control rods do not have their mass conserved and the control rod

        Interpolates a param axially to find it at any value of elevation z.

        By default, assumes that all parameters are for the center of a block. So for
        parameters such as THoutletTemperature that are defined on the top, this may be
        off. See the paramDefinedAt parameters.

        Defaults to linear interpolations.

        Notes
        -----
        This caches interpolators for each param and must be cleared if new params are
        set or new heights are set.

        WARNING: Fails when requested to extrapololate. With higher order splines it is
        possible to interpolate nonphysical values, for example a negative flux or dpa.
        Please use caution when going off default in interpType and be certain that
        interpolated values are physical.
