Reactor objects represent the highest level in the hierarchy of structures that compose the system
to be modeled. Core objects represent collections of assemblies.

Core is a high-level object in the data model in ARMI. They contain assemblies which in turn contain
more refinement in representing the physical reactor. The reactor is the owner of many of the
plant-wide state variables such as keff, cycle, and node.

            that border the outer core boundary (usually vacuum).

            If False, findNeighbors returns None for assemblies that do not exist in a 1/3
            core model (but WOULD exist in a full core model).

            1) in 1/3 core symmetry (with duplicateAssembliesOnReflectiveBoundary = True)
            would return a list of 6 assemblies, but those 6 would really only be

            Note that the value of duplicateAssembliesOnReflectiveBoundary only really if

            asymmetric models could find many duplicates in the other thirds

        Notes
        -----
        This only works for 1/3 or full core symmetry.

        This uses the 'mcnp' index map (MCNP GEODST hex coordinates) instead of the
        standard (ring, pos) map. because neighbors have consistent indices this way.  We
        then convert over to (ring, pos) using the lookup table that a reactor has.

        Returns
        -------
        neighbors : list of assembly objects
            This is a list of "nearest neighbors" to assembly a.

            If showBlanks = False, it will return fewer than 6 neighbors if not all 6
            neighbors explicitly exist in the core model.

            If showBlanks = True and duplicateAssembliesOnReflectiveBoundary = False, it
            will have a "None" for assemblies that do not exist in the 1/3 model.

            If showBlanks = True and duplicateAssembliesOnReflectiveBoundary = True, it
            will return the existing "symmetric identical" assembly of a non-existing
            assembly. It will only return "None" for an assembly when that assembly is
