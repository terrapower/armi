    Top level of the composite structure, potentially representing all components in a reactor.

    This class contains the core and any ex-core structures that are to be represented in the ARMI
    model. Historically, the ``Reactor`` contained only the core. To support better representation
    of ex-core structures, the old ``Reactor`` functionality was moved to the newer `Core` class,
    which has a ``Reactor`` parent.

        :id: I_ARMI_R

        The :py:class:`Reactor <armi.reactor.reactors.Reactor>` is the top level of the composite
        structure, which can represent all components within a reactor core. The reactor contains a
        :py:class:`Core <armi.reactor.reactors.Core>`, which contains a collection of
        :py:class:`Assembly <armi.reactor.assemblies.Assembly>` objects arranged in a hexagonal or
        Cartesian grid. Each Assembly consists of a stack of
        :py:class:`Block <armi.reactor.blocks.Block>` objects, which are each composed of one or
        more :py:class:`Component <armi.reactor.components.component.Component>` objects. Each
        :py:class:`Interface <armi.interfaces.Interface>` is able to interact with the reactor and
        its child :py:class:`Composites <armi.reactor.composites.Composite>` by retrieving data from
        it or writing new data to it. This is the main medium through which input information and
        the output of physics calculations is exchanged between interfaces and written to an ARMI
        database.
